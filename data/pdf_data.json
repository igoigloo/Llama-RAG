        "PwC | NIST post -quantum cryptography standards: Key questions and actions for implementation\nNIST post -quantum cryptography \nstandards: Key questions and \nactions for implementation\n1Organizations will now have what they need to start encrypting their information systems for post -quantum -\nbased attacks. The U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) \nfinalized its proposed principal set of encryption algorithms, issuing the first US standards for post -quantum \ncryptography. \nThe practice of cryptography is critical for safeguarding sensitive data and communication between information \nsystems, and these new standards reflect the latest evolution in the field. Encryption enables data in transit or \nat rest to be essentially \u201clocked\u201d by complex mathematical equations only to be unlocked by a solution \u201ckey .\u201d \nThis concept is known as public -key cryptology, whereby a public key is paired with a private key to create a \ncomplete cryptologic function. Effective encryption algorithms can reduce the risk of malicious actors gaining \nunauthorized access to underlying data. \nComplex algorithms can be solved with enough computational horsepower. However, current computer models \nlack the computing power necessary to overcome the most prevalent cryptologic standards in a timely manner. \nWith the rise of quantum computing , that\u2019s no longer the case .\nQuantum computation leverages quantum mechanics \u2013a revolutionary approach. The encryption in use today \nto guard everything from their emails to private information may soon be vulnerable to malicious actors who \ngain quantum computing capabilities. \nThe proposed NIST standards help address that concern and are aimed at helping government and \norganizations prepare for a post -quantum computing era.\nNIST encryption standards at a glance\nThis month, NIST released three post -quantum cryptography (PQC) standards to strengthen modern \npublic -key cryptography infrastructure for the quantum era .\n\u2022ML-KEM (derived from CRYSTALS -Kyber) is a key encapsulation mechanism selected for general \nencryption, such as accessing secured websites .\n\u2022ML-DSA (derived from CRYSTALS -Dilithium ) is a lattice -based algorithm for general -purpose digital \nsignature protocols .\n\u2022SLH-DSA (derived from SPHINCS+) isa stateless hash -based digital signature scheme .\nAlong with the encryption algorithms\u2019 code, the standards released by NIST include instructions on how to \nimplement them into products and encryption systems, and their intended uses.PwC | NIST post -quantum cryptography standards: Key questions and actions for implementation\nThe path to implementation\nWith the release of the standards, NIST is encouraging companies to begin implementation. As NIST explained \nin itsofficial announcement , integrating these algorithms into systems should happen now because full \nintegration and the process of implementation is going to take time . On top of that , threat actors are already \nmoving to gain computing capabilities to expose secrets and vulnerabilities across systems. \nIn response , many companies have started down the path of implementation by preparing for these standards \nand can now move ahead with confidence to better safeguard their organizations.\nQuestions to consider as you plan for implementation:\n1.Are we protecting our data for \u201charvest now, decrypt later\u201d attacks?\nCryptographic processes and migrations can take years to complete. In the meantime, threat actors are \ngetting a head start by stealing data and storing it until they can use a quantum computer to decrypt and \ngain access. Current data protection practices and risk controls need to account for post -quantum \ncryptography, and security leaders need to transition to the new NIST standards for the most critical \nresources. \n2.Have we considered our third -party relationships and the impacts on post -quantum cryptography?\nEven with these new encryption algorithms being available, organizations will need to understand all their \ndata and system dependencies, and that includes outside the organization. The process for aligning with \nthird-party vendors is an essential step to overcome blind spots and requires an understanding of what data \na third party holds on to, its data life-cycle management process, its current cryptologic standards and its \nplans for PQC, and any plans to update its service -level agreements.\n3.Are we prepared to meet regulatory requirements?\nThe expectation is that regulators will start to ask how organizations are approaching NIST encryption \nstandards as part of their post -quantum security protocols and practices. Along with NIST, CISA and \nISO/IEC have already started to account for stronger cryptography standards. And for organizations that \nwork with federal agencies, securing cryptography against current and future quantum threats is essential.\nWith NIST laying out itsstandards for encrypting sensitive information in anticipation of quantum -led \nattacks, organizations should have the tools they need to either get started or update their quantum \ntransformation plans immediately. \n2PwC | NIST post -quantum cryptography standards: Key questions and actions for implementation\nActions to take:\n1.Conduct an inventory of your most critical data for immediate and later -stage attacks\nIdentify your most sensitive and critical data and prioritize for migration to the new NIST standards. Assess \nthe risk of your critical data being targets for \u201cstored now, decrypted later\u201d attacks and consider integrating \nmore robust storage methods , security controls and risk controls . \n2.Assess which systems depend on cryptography and prioritize PQC integration\nInitiate a cryptologic discovery effort to inventory all systems handling data at rest and in transit. Develop \nprocesses to keep an up -to-date system of record for cryptologic infrastructure in the organization and \ncreate a transformation plan aligned to the new NIST standards. \n3.Identify those systems that are not able to handle PQC algorithms and plan for quantum -resistant \nalternatives \nDetermine where and why you\u2019re using public cryptography that can\u2019t transition to the new standards and \nmark those systems as quantum vulnerable. Develop a plan to risk -accept or begin a timeline to move data \nto a NIST -compliant storage solution, in line with your organization\u2019s risk appetite and policies. \n3Bottom line\nQuantum computing may be here sooner than some organizations might be anticipating. Companies that are \nalready factoring in post -quantum security practices as part of their overarching cybersecurity strategy are well -\npositioned to meet the challenges head on. \n\u00a9 2024 PwC.

The pivot arrived in \nsummer 2024 with eight magic words from Federal Reserve \nBank Chair Jay Powell: \u201cThe time has come for policy to \nadjust.\u201d With that pronouncement at the Fed\u2019s annual Jackson \nHole Economic Symposium in late August, Powell clearly \ncommunicated\tto\tmarkets\tthat\tinflation\thad\tbeen\ttamed\tand \t\nthe COVID era of tightening was ending.\nThe Fed followed through with an aggressive 50-basis-point \n(bp) cut in the federal funds rate (FFR) in mid-September. The \nSummary\tof\tEconomic\tProjections\u00a0that\taccompanied\tthe\trate \t\nannouncement revealed that the Fed expects to cut the FFR by \na further 50 bps by year-end 2024 and by another 100 bps in \n2025 for a total of 200 bps.\nReawaking Commercial Real Estate Capital Markets\nThe cuts were eagerly awaited by the commercial real estate \n(CRE) community and much appreciated when they were \nfinally\tannounced.\tAfter\ttwo\tyears\tof\tfalling\tproperty\tvalues \t\nand anemic transaction and lending activity, conditions seemed to stabilize this past summer. Though the Fed does \nnot\tdirectly\tcontrol\tmarket\tinterest\trates,\tfinancing\tcosts\ttend \t\nto parallel moves in the FFR, particularly the short-term debt \nthat funds most real estate deals and development projects.\nA consultant to the CRE sector explained, \u201cWith interest rates \ncoming down, it is likely that we are at the beginning of the \nnext expansionary phase of the real estate cycle.\u201d\nThe Fed\u2019s initial cut by itself will do little to bring down short-\nterm\tCRE\tfinancing\tcosts.\tHowever,\tthe\tFed\tpolicy\tchange \t\nsends a powerful signal to investors and borrowers that \nfinancial\tconditions\twill\tonly\timprove\tfrom\there.\t The\tFed\tmove \t\nalso helps reactivate CRE markets by bringing the price clarity \u201cWe are on the cusp of the next upturn in the real estate cycle, \nand now is the time to be thinking about planning, laying the \ngroundwork for the next two to three years of growth.\u201d\nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 20254needed to reduce bid-ask spreads and clear markets, as we \ndiscuss later in this chapter in the section on capital markets: \nA New Cycle Begins. \nAlready, the industry mood is brightening. The share of \nrespondents to the Emerging Trends  survey who expect their \nfirm\u2019s\tprofit\tto\tbe\t\u201cgood\u201d\tor\t\u201cexcellent\u201d\trose\tmore\tthan\t20 \t\npercentage points, from just 41 percent last year to 65 percent \nthis year. And those responses were the most common by a \n2:1\tmargin.\tLast\tyear,\ta\tplurality\t(45\tpercent)\texpected\tprofits \t\nto be just \u201cfair,\u201d and a substantial number (13 percent) feared \nthey would be \u201cabysmal\u201d or \u201cpoor,\u201d similar to the results in the \nyear before that. Those middling to low responses fell sharply \nthis year. \nStill, while expectations are optimistic, they are not wildly so. \nEven with responses representing improvement from the past \ntwo years, overall expectations were almost exactly equal to \ntheir long-term averages. Investors and borrowers are not \ncounting on a return to the halcyon prepandemic days of \ndouble-digit returns and abnormally low interest rates. As the \nhead\tof\tCRE\tfor\ta\tdata\tanalytics\tfirm\tsaid,\t\u201cWe\tare\tin\ta\tnew \t\ninterest rate regime. The neutral rate of interest is higher now \nthan it\u2019s been in the last couple of decades because of the \ndemographic shifts, because we\u2019ve exhausted cheap labor.\u201dCyclical Change Replaces Pandemic Shifts \nLast year, our central theme was \u201cA New Era Comes into \nFocus.\u201d We described the growing consensus in the CRE \ncommunity that market conditions and dynamics would not \nrevert to the way they were before the pandemic. Rather, a new \npost-COVID world was emerging. Remote working and online \nshopping would endure.\nThose expectations have largely come to pass. U.S. property \nmarkets are no longer undergoing the radical shifts in how \ntenants use space that we experienced in the immediate \naftermath of the pandemic. We are where we are. One \nexception is the meteoric rise of data center demand, which \nhas little connection to the pandemic and everything to do with \nthe\tmassive\texpansion\tof\tartificial\tintelligence\tapplications \t\nthroughout our economy.\nThat\u2019s not to say property markets are static. Change is the \none constant in the CRE sector. But the jarring pandemic shifts \nseem to be behind us, and investors\u2019 focus is swinging to the \nmore normal cyclical changes that occur over the course of \nbusiness cycles.\nTenant demand has recovered or surpassed prepandemic \nlevels in most property sectors, yet vacancies are rising \nin several key sectors. In many markets, record levels of \nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 20255\nChapter 1: The Time Has Comeconstruction are to blame. New supply is coming on line faster \nthan tenants can absorb it, as we explain in the section on \nsupply: Building Boom, Tenant Boon.\nHowever, concern is growing that tenant demand may not \nhold up much longer.

Many investors are \nready to pounce, especially with prices near cyclical lows. One \nsenior investment banker said, \u201cI think the environment right \nnow looks a little softer from a fundamental perspective, but I\u2019d \nsay it\u2019s a favorable transaction market. If you\u2019re looking for an \nentry\tpoint\tto\tbuy\tassets\tover\ta\tthree-\tto\tfive-year\tperiod,\twe \t\nthink it\u2019s an attractive entry point.\u201d \nOther industry leaders we interviewed are not so ready to jump \ninto the deep end of the transaction pool; they want to see more \ntransactions to prove out pricing levels. The chief investment \nofficer\tof\ta\tprominent\tinvestment\tmanagement\tfirm\tnoted,\t\u201cI \t\nwould argue that the sentiment is probably improving, but we\u2019re \nnot totally there yet. Until we get to a wider consensus of where \nit\u2019s going to be, and this is how to price real estate, I don\u2019t think \nyou\u2019re\tgoing\tto\tsee\tthe\tfloodgates\topen\ton\ttransactions.\u201d \t\nOverall, the consensus is that the market recovery will be \nslow and gradual. The regional leader of another investment \nmanager\tfirm\tconcluded,\t\u201cMy\tsense\tis\tthat\t2025\twill\tstart\tslow. \t\nIt\u2019ll pick up as the year goes along, and it\u2019ll be a decent year \nwhen everybody looks back at it. But I think 2026, 2027, out \nthere, it looks kind of exciting.\u201d\nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 20256Be Careful What You Wish For \nInterest\trates\tare\tcoming\tdown\u2014finally!\t That\u2019s\twhat\twe\tall \t\ndesperately wanted, right? But at what cost?\nInterest rates were ultra-low for ultra-long, and the real \nestate industry came to depend on them. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten \nspoiled by cheap credit for a long time,\u201d admitted the former \nhead\tof\tone\tleading\tinvestment\tmanagement\tfirm.\t\u201cPeople \t\nhave used leverage, not because they\u2019ve needed to, but \nbecause it\u2019s been a tactical tool to enhance returns.\u201d\nThe Cheap Debt Diet\nThe era of nearly free money began in the aftermath of the \nglobal\tfinancial\tcrisis\t(GFC)\tof\t2007\u20132008,\twhen\tthe\tFed \t\nfirst\tlowered\tthe\tfederal\tfunds\trate\tto\tnear\tzero\tin\ta\tfrantic \t\nattempt to revive the economy. Interest rates had barely \nstarted to rise when the Fed repeated its strategy a decade \nlater to counter the downturn stemming from the COVID-19 \npandemic. Cheap debt had become the new normal. \nThen it ended. Anxiety quickly took hold throughout the CRE \ncommunity when the Fed took away the proverbial punch \nbowl and started to hike interest rates in March 2022 in the \nface\tof\tsurging\tinflation.\tInvestors\tfeared\tthat\teven\tlimited \t\nexpected interest rate rises could undermine acquisition \nand development feasibility.\nIn the end, the increases proved to be anything but modest. \nThe Fed ultimately hiked the FFR 11 times, pushing up \nthe rate by more than 500 bps from near zero to over 5 \npercent\u2014and then kept them elevated longer than most \nanyone expected. The increase in the benchmark 10-year \nTreasury rate was less extreme, rising just over 300 bps. \nStill, the damage was done: Investor nervousness quickly \nprogressed into alarm and then outright panic, and sales \ntransactions dried up while lending volumes plunged.\nIn the Emerging Trends  survey conducted before the Fed\u2019s \ninitial rate hike, \u201cinterest rates and cost of capital\u201d was the \nthird\tgreatest\teconomic/financial\tconcern.\tIn\tlast\tyear\u2019s \t\nsurvey, it jumped to the leading concern, far outdistancing \nany other issue. In fact, its 4.70 score on a 1-to-5 scale was \nthe greatest concern registered in any category going back \nover a decade of Emerging Trends  surveys.Cheaper but Not Cheap Debt\nThat concern has eased but not disappeared. \u201cInterest rates \nand cost of capital\u201d is still the leading concern raised by \nrespondents in the latest Emerging Trends  survey, but its \nimportance has dropped 40 bps to 4.30. This lower but still \nelevated\tlevel\tof\tconcern\tpartly\treflects\tthe\ttiming\tof\tthe \t\nsurvey, which was conducted during the summer of 2024. \nAt that time, the cut was widely expected, but the Fed\u2019s \ndecision wasn\u2019t announced until mid-September. \nThe sense of relief was palpable in the interviews with \nindustry leaders conducted once the cut was all but \ncertain, even if the 50-bp cut was not enough to alter deal \neconomics fundamentally. \u201cIt\u2019s the signal more than the \nlevel. It\u2019s a psychological boost that the Fed\u2019s effectively \nsaying, \u2018We\u2019re pivoting. We think that we\u2019ve done what we \nneed to do.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t change the math much, but it does \nchange the behavior potentially,\u201d said the head of product \nmanagement\tfor\ta\tleading\tCRE\tanalytics\tfirm.\nAdditional help is on the way. More than 80 percent of \nrespondents to this year\u2019s Emerging Trends  survey believe \nthat commercial mortgage rates will decrease in 2025, \nand 75 percent expect rates to decline further in the next \nfive\u00a0years.\nTrend #1:Emerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 20257\nChapter 1: The Time Has ComeAs an industry that relies heavily on leverage to get deals \ndone (or simply boost returns), commercial real estate \nreflexively\tappreciates\tlow-cost\tdebt\u2014and\tthe\tlower,\tthe \t\nbetter. However, astute investors know that interest rates \ndo\tnot\tmove\tin\tisolation\tbut\treflect\tmarket\texpectations\tof \t\nfuture\teconomic\tand\tfinancial\tconditions.\tIn\tshort,\tinterest \t\nrates tend to fall when the economic outlook darkens, \nportending deteriorating operating conditions for CRE \nproperties. Indeed, the Fed lowers interest rates expressly \nto stimulate a faltering economy.\nLanding the Plane\nThe economy stubbornly refuses to oblige. As of the early \nfall of 2024, the economy is still performing remarkably \nwell.\tReal\tgross\tdomestic\tproduct\t(GDP)\tin\tthe\tfirst\thalf \t\nof 2024 grew at a healthy annualized rate of 2.4 percent, \nclose to what many economists believe to be its long-run \npotential. Much of the credit goes to consumer spending, \nwhich\tdefied\texpectations\tof\ta\tslowdown\tand\tgrew\tthe \t\nfastest of all GDP components over the past year.\nThe job market continues to roll as employers keep \nadding workers and more people enter the labor force. \nUnemployment remains historically low. And employment \ngrowth is still averaging a relatively robust 200,000 new \njobs per month in 2024, though generally cooling over \nthe past year. Wall Street approves, too: The major stock \nmarket indices frequently hit new all-time highs, suggesting \ngrowing\tconfidence\tin\tthe\teconomic\toutlook.\nMost\tnotably,\tthe\tFed\tbelieves\tit\thas\tfinally\ttamed\tinflation, \t\nsetting the foundation for the recent and anticipated future\trate\tcuts.\tBringing\tdown\tinflation\twhile\tkeeping\tthe \t\neconomy aloft\u2014the proverbial \u201csoft landing\u201d\u2014is no easy \nfeat.\tAs\tthe\thead\tof\tone\tdevelopment\tfirm\texplained,\t\u201cThe \t\nFed has been trying to land a 747 on an aircraft carrier with \nthis soft landing . . . and it\u2019s never been done before.\u201d\nCan the Fed land the plane? The latest Wall Street Journal  \nsurvey of economists, conducted in July 2024, before the \nFed\u2019s September rate cut, forecasts real GDP growth of \naround 2 percent in 2025 and 2026. That growth is slower \nthan the current rate but avoids a recession. Similarly, \nconsumer\tconfidence \tin\tvarious\tindices\tremains\tabove \t\nrecessionary levels though it\u2019s hardly optimistic.\nHowever,\tfinancial\tmarkets\tseem\tto\tbe\ta\tbit\tmore \t\npessimistic. Unlike the growth seen in the stock market \nindices, the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds has been \nfalling steadily since the spring of 2024. This decline began \nwell before the Fed started easing monetary policy, perhaps \nsignaling expectations of decelerating economic growth. \nAs the head of a real estate investment bank said, \u201cThe \nfixed-income\tmarkets\tare\tdefinitely\tpricing\ta\tlittle\tbit\tfaster \t\nslowdown of economic activity than the equity markets.\u201d\nAll these points together present a decidedly mixed outlook \nfor commercial real estate markets. In isolation, the lower \ninterest rates will be welcomed. More transactions will be \nable \tto\tmove\tforward,\tand\tmore\tloans\twill\tbe\trefinanced. \t\nThat means more deal activity for brokers, investors, and \nlenders. That\u2019s all good. However, slower economic and job \ngrowth reduces growth in net operating income. Tenant \ndemand may fall as job growth moderates, affecting space \nabsorption, occupancy, and rent growth. And weakening \nfundamentals also constrain demand for CRE assets and \nlimit price appreciation. This is the yin and the yang of \nfalling interest rates.\nA (Somewhat) More Certain Outlook \nThe Fed\u2019s pivot on monetary policy, beyond the almost \npurely\tpsychological\tbump\tof\tthe\tfirst\tcut,\tbrings\tone\tother \t\nkey\tbenefit:\tgreater\tcertainty\ton\tthe\tfuture\tdirection\tof \t\nfinancial\tconditions.\tMany\tmarket\tparticipants\thave\tbeen \t\nbiding their time on the sidelines, waiting for greater clarity \nand more affordable debt.

In just the last \n30 days, people have been coming out of the woodwork. \nEveryone has been working hard and banging their heads \nagainst the proverbial rocks, trying to get deals to pencil \nand turning over and kicking pieces of dirt.\u201d\nTo be sure, the industry still feels a heightened level of \nuncertainty,\twhich\tis\ttypical\tat\tinflection\tpoints\tin\tthe \t\nbusiness cycle. \u201cThe future trajectory of the economy \nlooks as tenuous and uncertain as ever,\u201d says one leading \nindustry consultant. Much of the uncertainty is rooted in \npolitical issues, particularly the November election and \nglobal geopolitical risks. (See the sidebar, Issues to Watch.) \nNonetheless, the responses to this year\u2019s survey overall \nreveal\tmuch\tmore\tconsensus\ton\tkey\tfinancial\tmetrics\u2014and more positive outlooks\u2014than at any point since the \nonset of the pandemic. Said the head of CRE economics \nat\ta\tdata\tanalytics\tfirm,\t\u201cThe\tconsensus\tallows\tthe\treal \t\nestate industry to move forward. That doesn\u2019t mean we \nhave strong performance, but it allows markets to clear \nand\ttransaction\tactivities\tto\tpick\tup\tenough\tto\tfind\ta\tnew \t\nequilibrium without there being an apocalypse. Now we can \nclear the markets. Now we can get price discovery.\u201d\nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 20259\nChapter 1: The Time Has ComeA New Cycle Begins \nReal estate capital markets are recovering. \u201cWe\u2019re on the \nearly end of the healing process, but we\u2019re excited about \nthe opportunities we\u2019re seeing,\u201d said one investment banker. \n\u201cLiquidity is steadily improving every day. [Capitalization] \nrates aren\u2019t necessarily going back to those historic lows \nbecause growth rates aren\u2019t there. But every few weeks, \nyou\u2019re seeing more bids in the market, you\u2019re seeing pricing \nget a little bit tighter, you\u2019re seeing debt spreads get tighter.\u201d\nThat sentiment summarizes the views of many investors \nand analysts interviewed for this edition of Emerging Trends . \nThe Fed\u2019s new direction and clear guidance on future moves \nare aiding in the price discovery needed to reduce bid-ask \nspreads between buyers and sellers. Plus, the lower debt \ncosts are improving deal economics for more projects. \nTogether, these factors will encourage more investors and \ndevelopers to move off the sidelines and transact, whether \nto\tbuy,\tsell,\tlend,\tborrow,\tor\trefinance.\tHowever,\tin\tmany\t\nmarkets, development still seems further off. \nMore Lending, More Deals\nConditions are still challenging, if improving a bit. \nThe regional head of a global real estate investment \nmanagement\tfirm\tnoted,\t\u201cIt\u2019s\tstill\tquite\tdifficult\tto\taccess\t\ncapital markets, but there is lending that\u2019s going on now that \nhasn\u2019t\tbeen\tthere\tin\tthe\tpast,\tand\teven\tin\tthe\toffice\tsector.\u201d\nMost respondents to the Emerging Trends  industry survey \nbelieve that CRE debt markets are still undersupplied for \nall types of activity, including acquisitions (55 percent), \nrefinancing\t(58\tpercent),\tand\tespecially\tdevelopment \t\n(75 percent). However, the trends are moving in the right \ndirection, with more people than last year, albeit still a \nminority,\tfinding\tthat\tmarkets\tare\tin\tbalance\tand\tfewer \t\nfeeling that markets are undersupplied. And industry \nparticipants expect better conditions ahead, with debt \navailability increasing broadly among most lender sources.\nThose survey results track with industry statistics. The \nMortgage Bankers Association (MBA) calculated that in \nthe\tfirst\thalf\tof\t2024,\tCRE\tlending\tincreased\tby\t2\tpercent \t\nover the same period last year. That level of growth is not a banner achievement, but it\u2019s a huge improvement over the \n54 percent decline registered in 2023. \nThe MBA expects further improvement as interest rates \ndecline, more properties transact, and more loans mature. \nThey forecast originations will rise 26 percent for all of \n2024 to $539 billion. That would be well shy of the record-\nshattering volumes of 2021 and 2022, when all types \nof\tproperty\ttransactions\tsoared\tbriefly\tas\tthe\teconomy \t\nreopened following the pandemic lockdown, but close to the \nmore normal levels achieved in 2018 and 2019 before COVID \ntransformed property market dynamics. The MBA expects \nlending to grow an additional 24 percent in 2025, which would \nmark a full recovery back to prepandemic conditions. \nThe\thead\tof\tCRE\tinvestment\tbanking\tat\ta\tmajor\tfinancial \t\ninstitution said this: \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see more and \nmore normalization in debt markets. As you start to see \nrepayments and people\u2019s real estate exposure goes down, \nthey\u2019re going to want to create new real estate exposure \nto replace it at new levels. So I think that velocity will start \nto\u00a0normalize.\u201d\nThe equity side has a similar story, though the recovery is \nless complete. Sales transactions were still falling slightly \nat the start of 2024, though less than in prior quarters, \nand volumes seemed to stabilize midyear. Nevertheless, \nTrend #2:Emerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 202510\nsales\twere\ta\tthird\tlower\tin\tthe\tfirst\thalf\tof\t2024\trelative\tto \t\nthe same period average from 2015 to 2019, according \nto transaction data compiled by MSCI. Adjusting for price \nappreciation in the intervening years would show an even \ngreater disparity. Though the situation varies dramatically \nby sector, sales are down for every major property type. \nEven in the beloved industrial sector, the dollar value of \nsales\tin\tthe\tfirst\thalf\tof\t2024\twas\tabout\t4\tpercent\tbelow\tits \t\nprepandemic\taverage.\tAt\tthe\tother\textreme,\toffice\tsales\tare \t\nmore than 60 percent below their prepandemic average.\nStill, industry participants are optimistic that the economy \nis turning a corner. The head of a CRE investment bank \nsaid, \u201cNow that people have clarity around the direction \nof\trates,\tavailability\tof\tfinancing,\tcost\tof\tfinancing,\tand \t\neconomic\tclarity,\twe \tare\tdefinitely\tseeing\ta\tpipeline\tthat \t\nis growing each month and each quarter of transaction \nactivity. And I think in 2025 and 2026, we get back to \nthe 2018, 2019 level of transaction activity, which would \nbecome a normalized market.\u201d\nThe Long Road to Price Recovery\nAnother key to ramping up transaction activity will be \nreversing, or at least stabilizing of recent price declines. \nCapitalization (cap) rates began rising when prices last \npeaked in mid-2022 and continued increasing until evidently \nplateauing\tin\tearly\t2024.\t The\tmost\trecent\tfigures\t(as\tof \t\nmid-2024) suggest prices might be turning positive again, \nthough\tthe \tgains\tmay\tsimply\treflect\tthat\thigher-quality \t\nproduct is accounting for a larger share of transactions. As one leading industry analyst put it, \u201cWhen you look at \nthe value per square foot on transactions, they tend to be \nquite a bit above historical averages. And obviously, it\u2019s not \nbecause prices are higher, which tells me not that values \nare up, but rather that better quality assets are what\u2019s \ntrading today.\u201d\nRegardless of whether recent price gains are real or even \nsustainable, the consensus seems to be that\u2014leaving aside \ndowntown\toffice\tbuildings\u2014at\tleast\tprices\tare\tno\tlonger \t\nfalling, which is an important milestone. No investor wants \nto buy today what may be less expensive tomorrow, so \nevidence of price stability would motivate more investors \nto reenter the market. A prominent CRE investment banker \nsaid,\t\u201cOur\tview\thas\tbeen\tthat\tpricing\ttroughed\tin\tthe\tfirst \t\nhalf of this year for many in-favor assets, and we wanted to \nbe a buyer of that fact pattern.\u201d\nThe Emerging Trends  survey revealed other positive signs \nas well. Slightly more respondents believe cap rates will \ndecrease in 2025 than think cap rates will stay the same; \nbarely 10 percent expect cap rates to rise. Moreover, the \nbuy-sell-hold barometer scored its highest \u201ctime to buy\u201d and \nthe\tlowest\t\u201csell\u201d\trating\tsince \tthe\tGFC.\t These\tratings\treflect \t\nstrong expectations of price increases and widespread \nbelief that now is a propitious entry point for new \nacquisitions\u2014a frequent comment in our interviews.\nBut if cap rates have indeed peaked for this cycle, prices \nstill have a long way to go before recovering their peak \nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 202511\nChapter 1: The Time Has Comeprices. According to Green Street\u2019s price index, CRE prices \nfell more than 20 percent since their last peak, and the \ncore\tsectors\u2014office,\tretail,\tmultifamily,\tand\tindustrial\u2014\ncollectively fell even further. (Alternative sectors such as \nself-storage and student housing modestly outperformed \nthe four core sectors). As of mid-2024, assets have \nregained\tless\tthan\ta\tfifth\tof\ttheir\tlost\tvalue.\nAs with transaction volumes, the pain is shared widely \nbut\tnot\tequally\tacross\tthe\tvarious\tproperty\tsectors.\tOffice \t\nvalues, for example, are down by more than a third from \ntheir\tpeak\ton\taverage,\twhile\tapartments\tare\tdown\ta\tfifth \t\nand hotels only a tenth. And some asset types might not \nyet\thave\treached\tbottom.\tWith\tregard\tto\toffice\tassets, \t\none investment manager said, \u201cThere\u2019s still lots of people \nout there afraid of catching a falling knife. We need more \ntransactions\tin\toffice\tfor\tme\tto\tsay,\t\u2018Okay,\tnow\twe\tcan \tgo\tup\tfrom\there.\u2019\tI\tjust\tdon\u2019t\tknow\twhere\twe\tare\tin\toffice \t\nexactly.\u201d Interviewees also expressed similar views about \nmultifamily properties in some oversupplied markets.\nBut overall, market participants feel prices are heading \nback in the right direction, even if the adjustment will take \ntime. One investment banking leader said, \u201cCap rates have \ncome\tdown,\tso\tthe\tmarket\tis\tdefinitely\tpricing\tin\tthis\tsofter \t\nlanding and lower rate outlook. In the favorite asset classes, \nsome of this is already priced in. Hopefully, it continues, and \nwe continue to see a gradual move back upward in value.\u201d\nYet owners should not expect prices to hit prepandemic \nlevels for some time. As another investment banker said, \n\u201cCap rates aren\u2019t necessarily going back to those historic \nlows because growth rates aren\u2019t there.\u201d\nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 202512\nDistress Still Not So Distressing\nOne topic that is not top of mind for industry participants \nis the \u201cwall of maturities\u201d of CRE properties with maturing \ndebt, estimated by Trepp to top $1.2 trillion in 2024 and \n2025. This includes a large pool of assets worth less than \ntheir\tdebt,\tparticularly\tin\tthe\tbeleaguered\toffice\tsector. \t\nMuch of that debt was rolled over from prior years in the \ntimeless dance of \u201cextend and pretend.\u201d And once again, the \npractice seems to be working for many lenders and owners. \nAs prices start to recover and interest rates decline, the \nparties will have more opportunity to reach agreement.\nFor now, delinquencies on structured debt, such as \ncommercial mortgage-backed securities, remain well below \nlevels seen after the GFC, although these are still early days. \nOne debt analyst said, \u201cWe\u2019re maybe two years into value \ndownturn, so we won\u2019t hit the peak delinquency, if history is \nan\tindicator,\tuntil\tmaybe\tfour\tyears,\tfive\tyears\tpast.\tWe\twill \t\ninevitably have distress within commercial real estate as we \nmove\tfrom\tan\tinterest\trate\tperiod\tthat\twas\tartificially\tlow \t\nto an interest rate period that is much more in line with the \nreality of the economy.\u201d \nHowever,\tthere\tseems\tto\tbe \tconfidence\tthat\tmany\tof \t\nthese deals will get worked out as liquidity returns to CRE \ncapital markets. A senior adviser to a leading investment \nmanagement\tfirm\tsaid,\t\u201cThere\u2019s\tso\tmuch\tcapital\tthat\tneeds \t\nto move around in real estate. . . . There\u2019s a lot of queued-up selling. And then on the buy side, there\u2019s a lot of money that \nneeds to get into real estate because the stock market has \nbeen so buoyant.\u201d\nThese factors and attitudes could justify the belief that the \nindustry is, indeed, \u201con the cusp of the next upturn in the \nreal estate cycle,\u201d as expressed in the lead industry quote \nfor this chapter.\nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 202513\nChapter 1: The Time Has ComeBuilding Boom, Tenant Boon \nThe pandemic triggered profound shifts in how tenants use \ndifferent types of space: how much, where, and what kind. \nThe changes began with the lockdown as many sectors \nof the economy were forced to adapt to new ways of \noperating, and many of those adaptations have endured in \nsome form. By now, these shifts have either largely played \nout, or their direction is reasonably foreseeable.\nOffice\tworkers\tcommute\tto\tthe\tworkplace\tless\tfrequently; \t\nconsumers shop more online; and more goods than \never are stored in warehouses. All these effects have \naltered space usage patterns. The pandemic also forced \nsignificant\tchanges\tin\tthe\ttypes\tand\tlocations\tof\thomes \t\nthat households want to buy and rent. People want more \nspace at home to work and prefer less dense suburban \nneighborhoods, which they perceive as safer and healthier.\nLess heralded but perhaps even more remarkable is that \noverall space demand has more than recovered in most \nsectors. Indeed, occupied space now exceeds prepandemic \nlevels as demand remains robust across most property types. \nNot every sector, of course. A painful reckoning is taking \nplace\tin\tthe\toffice\tsector,\tand\tfew\texperts\texpect\toffice \tspace \t\ndemand to return to anything approaching prepandemic \nlevels\t(see\tthe\tdiscussion\tin\tthe\tchapter\t2\toffice\toutlook).\nDespite the broad demand recovery, vacancy rates are rising \nacross many property types as surging supply outpaces \nabsorption in many markets. All this new construction is \nswinging the power pendulum to the tenants. Tenants \nare exploiting softer market conditions in different ways \nin different property sectors. In some sectors, tenants are \nsimply leveraging rising vacancies to negotiate lower rents. \nHowever, in other sectors, occupiers are taking advantage of \nthe availability of a new class of higher-quality construction \nto upgrade their workplaces and leave behind their older, less \nfunctional space. These moves are creating a performance \nchasm between newer and older buildings.\nHaves and Have-Nots in Retail Continues\nThis supply-facilitated bifurcation differs from the demand-\ndriven bifurcation trend that preceded it. The bifurcation \ntrend began in the retail sector over a decade ago when shoppers and retailers started to abandon redundant \nshopping centers in favor of the best-located and best-\ntenanted centers. The winners were not necessarily the \nnewest: Frequently, older centers commanded the best \nlocations, preventing newer entrants from gaining a \nfoothold. But the divide between the haves and have-nots \ngrew as e-commerce devastated outdated department \nstores\tand\tsuperfluous\tretail\tspace.\nThat divide between the haves and have-nots continues to \nthis day, as different retail types are performing differently. \nThe number of successful malls keeps falling, for example, \nwhile occupied space in necessity retailing, like grocery-\nanchored centers, is rising. Importantly, this bifurcation \nmanifested despite the almost complete absence of new \nconstruction.\nThe Flight to Quality Office\nA\tdifferent\tstory\tis\tplaying\tout\tin\tthe\toffice\tsector,\twhich \t\nwas the next property type to see a split in its fortunes. \nVacancies surged during the pandemic, and the amount \nof occupied space continues to fall four years later \ndespite\tincreased\temployment\tin\toffice-type\toccupations. \t\nConstruction has sunk to historic lows, but much of the \nnew supply has been superior to what was available \npreviously. Leasing in these newer buildings has far \noutperformed as tenants seek out premium space that is \nTrend #3:Emerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 202514viewed as healthier and more productive. Firms see top-\nquality space as an essential differentiator in attracting \nnew\tworkers\tto\ttheir\tfirm\tand\tcurrent\tworkers\tback\tto\tthe \t\noffice.\tMeanwhile,\tolder\tbuildings\tare\tincreasingly\tregarded \t\nas obsolete, as even extensive (and expensive) renovations \noften are not enough to compete with newer product and \nattract new tenants or retain existing ones.\nThe Spread to Industrial\nNow the bifurcation trend is spreading. \u201cIt started very \nmuch\tin\toffice,\tbut\twe\u2019re\tseeing\tit\tin\tother\tsectors\tas\twell, \t\nnotably industrial,\u201d said the head of a prominent investment \nmanagement\tfirm.\nWhen the pandemic prompted a dramatic surge in online \nshopping,\tthe\tindustrial\tsector\tfound\titself\twith\ta\tsignificant \t\nshortage of warehouse and third-party logistics facilities. \nDevelopers responded with record construction. Leading \ncommercial real estate (CRE) brokerages report that more \nthan 1 billion square feet of new product was added in the \nlast two years alone, far exceeding prior records.\nNet absorption has been positive, meaning more space is \noccupied than ever before. Yet demand has not kept pace \nwith new supply, so the amount of vacant space keeps \nclimbing. Vacancy rates are now higher than they have been \nin a decade. As outlined in the industrial sector discussion \nin chapter 2, this new vacant supply is providing tenants \nwith the opportunity for \u201csmart growth\u201d and increasing the \ndivide between newer class A and more commodity class B \nand C warehouses.Real\testate\tservices\tfirm\tCBRE\ttallied\talmost\t400\tmillion \t\nsquare feet of positive net absorption in the 18 months \nfrom 2023 through mid-2024 among buildings delivered \nduring the same period. At the same time, net absorption \nwas negative for warehouses constructed between 2000 \nand 2022, with buildings over 25 years old suffering the \nworst\toutflows.\nWhat do tenants want? They want more modern features \nsuch\tas\taccess\tto\tpower,\thigh\tenergy\tefficiency,\tand\thigher \t\nclear ceilings that make the facilities more productive. In \naddition, warehouse occupiers are increasingly motivated \nby the \u201cwar for talent\u201d and thus prioritize the kinds of \nwellness\tamenities\tthat\toffice\ttenants\tdemand,\tlike \t\nsuperior ventilation and more direct natural light. And for \nmany tenants, the right location is the most critical feature \nof all. The leader of a logistics company explained that \u201cwith \nnext-day delivery still growing, proximity to major metro \nareas is becoming ever more important.\u201d\nThis\t\u201cflight\tto\tquality\u201d\ttrend\tis\texpected\tto\tlast\ta\twhile \t\nlonger as vacancy rates keep climbing, but the favorable \nconditions for tenants will soon abate as the delivery \npipeline slows.\nA Dramatic, Likely Short-Lived, Reversal for Multifamily\nA different supply dynamic entirely is playing out in \nthe multifamily sector. Like industrial, this sector has \nexperienced a construction explosion in the past couple \nyears, particularly in fast-growing Sunbelt markets. The \nresult has been rising vacancies and falling rents in the \nmost oversupplied markets. Rents declined nationally in \nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 202515\nChapter 1: The Time Has Comeeach\tof\tthe\tfirst\ttwo\tquarters\tof\t2024\tby\tthe\tmost\tsince \t\nbefore the pandemic.\nThat scenario represents a sea change in this historically \nundersupplied sector and a rare triumph for tenants. But it \nis not likely to last for long. For one thing, construction is \nslowing, and the number of projects in the pipeline is falling. \nExplains one investment banker, \u201cReplacement costs are \ngenerally above asset costs, so you get a discount by \nbuying assets.\u201d Developers will need to wait until rents \nagain justify new construction.\nDespite all the new supply, there is still not nearly enough \nconstruction to keep pace with population growth, since \nmany households cannot afford to purchase homes. The \nshortage is particularly severe at more affordable price points, \nas explained in the housing affordability theme later in this \nchapter, Many Solutions, No Answers. Thus, the oversupply \nseen in some markets is not viewed as severe. The head of \nreal-assets\tresearch\tteam\tfor\ta\tdata\tanalytics\tfirm\tsaid,\t\u201cThe \t\napartment market has some softness, but I characterize it as \n\u2018a little bit\u2019 of softness. We\u2019re still undersupplied on housing \nnationally.\tAnd\tit\u2019s\tnot\tlike\tright\tbefore\tthe\tfinancial\tcrisis, \t\nwhen we needed a million units per year, and we\u2019re delivering \n2 million units per year. It\u2019s not that kind of excess.\u201d\nData Centers and Life Science\nSupply issues are playing out very differently in two \ntech-focused niche sectors: data centers and life science \nfacilities. Data centers have been the top choice of \nEmerging Trends  survey respondents for two years running \nfor both investment and development prospects, far \noutpacing all other subsectors (see chapter 2). The reason \nis\tclear:\tEnormous\tand\tspiraling\tdemand\tsignificantly \t\nexceeds the market\u2019s ability to deliver new space.The reason for the shortfall is equally apparent: Data \ncenters have massive power requirements, and few sites \nare available that can deliver that amount of power in a \nsetting that can accommodate the large physical footprint \nof these facilities. This power requirement thus acts as a \n\u201cnon\u2013real\testate\u2013driven\tconstraint\ton\tsupply,\u201d\taccording \t\nto one investment banker. \u201cSo that means there\u2019ll be good \nfundamentals for a really, really long time, because we can\u2019t \nbuild enough of it.\u201d\nAdvantage: landlords.

The impact \nis substantial: 30 percent of households that moved due to \nremote work policies relocated to a different city, and 13 \npercent moved to a new state. This shift is fueling the development of mixed-use \u201csurban\u201d \ncommunities\u2014a term coined by John Burns Research and \nConsulting in 2016.

Without immigration, the United States faces\tpotential\tlabor\tshortages\tthat\tcould\tstifle\tgrowth, \t\nreduce demand for homes and commercial spaces, and \nraise construction labor costs. However, with continued \nimmigration, the U.S. working-age population is projected to \nexpand by more than 10 million in the next decade, fueling \ndemand for all types of real estate and helping relieve \ncosts.\nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 202520\nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 202521\nChapter 1: The Time Has Come\n\u2014John Burns Research and Consulting LLCEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 202522\nNow Where? \nThe pandemic rattled property markets in some fundamental \nways. In the preceding trend, we highlighted some of the \nways in which tenants have shifted the kinds and amount \nof space they demand. They have also shifted where they \nwant to work and live, both within and among regions. The \npandemic prompted households and businesses to move \nfrom central cities to more outlying suburban and exurban \nareas. It also strengthened preexisting migration patterns \nfrom colder Northeast and Midwest metropolitan areas to \nwarmer Sunbelt climates in the south and west.\nThose patterns are continuing, but the surge in Sunbelt \nand suburban migration appears to be moderating and \ntransforming. Climate change may already be playing a \nrole and seems poised to trigger more shifts in the years \nahead. But other factors, such as housing affordability and \nperceived quality of life, are also playing roles.\nMoving Less Overall\nInterstate migration in the United States has been rising \nfor\tmany\tyears,\teven\tas\tlocal\tmoves\tare\tdeclining.\tOfficial\t\nmigration\tdata\tsets\tonly\tbecome\tavailable\tafter\ta\tsignificant\t\n(two-year) lag, so the most current reliable data dates to \nmid-2022.

Soaring home prices are one \nobvious reason: Fewer renters can afford to make the move \nfrom renting to homeownership, which is a key cause of \nresident turnover. Another important reason is that fewer \nhouseholds are relocating to take new jobs.\nThe high cost of relocation\u2014including the cost of a home \npurchase\u2014is a factor here, too. However, also important is \nthe increase in remote work options. While the share of job \nlistings that allow for remote or hybrid work has fallen from \nits\tpeak,\taccording\tto\tthe\tjob\tsearch\tfirm\tIndeed,\tthe\tshare \t\nis still three times greater than before the pandemic\u2014and \nmore for higher-compensated jobs like those in tech and \nprofessional\tservices.\tWhen\tfirms\tcan\trecruit\tfrom\ta\twider \t\ngeographic area, workers need not relocate to take a job in a different region. Of course, the opposite is also true: \nWorkers can stay with their current job while relocating to \nanother metro area. That trend seems to be less common, \nbut\tdefinitive\tdata\tis\tlacking. \t\nModerating Patterns\nDemographic analysis by John Burns Research and \nConsulting reveals changing migration patterns (see the \nsidebar, Demographics Steering Real Estate Markets in \n2025 and Beyond). While broad postpandemic migration \npatterns continue from the Frost Belt to the Sunbelt, many \nmetro areas that had attracted strong in-migration earlier \nin the decade are now seeing only moderate gains. These \ninclude Atlanta, Dallas/Fort Worth, and Houston, among \nothers. Austin and Phoenix both had strong in-migration \nfollowing the pandemic, but now their net migration is \nbarely positive. Meanwhile, some key Florida markets, \nincluding Orlando, Tampa, and Southwest Florida, are \nseeing outright population losses.\nTrend #4:Emerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 202523\nChapter 1: The Time Has ComeThe rankings of some of these markets slipped this year in \nthe Emerging Trends  market ratings (chapter 3). However, \nmost of these markets still scored very high, with all but \nSouthwest Florida in the 15 top-rated markets\u2014suggesting \nsurvey respondents might be out of step with emerging \nmigration trends. Similarly, industry participants also \nmay be missing the positive impacts of international in-\nmigration, which counters the large domestic out-migration \nin many large metro areas in California, including Los \nAngeles, Oakland, and San Francisco. These markets have \nfallen out of favor in the Emerging Trends  ratings.\nWhat accounts for these moderating migration patterns? \nThe declining cost-of-living advantage\u2014especially in housing \naffordability\u2014formerly enjoyed by many fast-growing Sunbelt \nmetro areas. According to the research director of a real \nestate\tanalytics\tfirm,\t\u201cWhether\tit\u2019s\tinsurance\tor\tjust\tcost\tof \t\nliving, that gap has closed somewhat between the Sunbelt \nand some coastal markets. You\u2019re not going to see massive \nmigrations in the next few years.\u201d Another prominent CRE \nadviser noted, \u201cMore than anything, much of that housing \naffordability advantage is drying up already. I think that the \nmigration to the Sunbelt has already moderated. But that was \nexpected because you couldn\u2019t keep up the path of the shock \nof the pandemic and all the people moving.\u201d \nOther interviewees also mentioned \u201cgrowing pains\u201d in fast-\ngrowing\tmarkets\tthat\tdid\tnot\tinvest\tsufficiently\tin\tcritical \t\ninfrastructure such as roads and transit. The head of CRE \nat\tanother\tdata\tanalytics\tfirm\tconcluded,\t\u201cSome\tof\tit\tis\tjust \t\nyou\u2019re going to run out of people that are willing to move to \nan area like that for a variety of lifestyle reasons.\u201d\nThe Impact of Climate Change\nBeyond these growing pains, many experts believe climate \nchange is now starting to affect location decisions. Though \nlimited now, the trend is likely to accelerate as climate \nimpacts\u2014and their costs to property owners\u2014rise over time.\nThe Migration Policy Institute points out, \u201cHuman mobility \nlinked to environmental drivers is not new, but global \nclimate change is triggering more internal and international \nmigration and displacement.\u201d The concept of climate \nmigration has been generally applied to impoverished \nregions like Somalia and Honduras, where millions of people \nhave been displaced by drought or rising temperatures. Now \nit may be occurring in more developed nations.Evidence is growing that climate change\u2014and the risk of \nfurther change\u2014is affecting domestic migration patterns in \nthe United States, discouraging households from moving \nto the hitherto fast-growing markets. A recent study by the \nSan Francisco Federal Reserve Bank found migration from \ncolder Snowbelt places to hotter Sunbelt metro areas has \nslowed\tover\tthe\tpast\tfive\tdecades,\tnotwithstanding\tthe\t\nsurge after the pandemic. The study found that migration is \nslowing\tthe\tmost\tamong\tage\tgroups\t20\u201329\tand\t60\u201369,\tthe\t\ncohorts most likely to be making long-term location choices.\nAgain, some of the decline in interregional migration to \nthe Sunbelt might be explained by the waning relative \naffordability that had been a powerful attraction to these \nmarkets. But there seems little doubt that climate is playing \na role. A Freddie Mac analysis of data from the latest Survey \nof Household Economics and Decision Making found that \nin 2023, natural disaster concerns prompted one in seven \nhouseholds to investigate other places to live, including 16 \npercent of respondents under age 45. Clearly, climate issues \nare a growing consideration in location decisions.\nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 202524\nInsurance and Risks\nClimate migration is unlikely to reverse longstanding patterns \nrapidly, but change is coming, particularly as climate impacts \nand costs accelerate. The average number of billion-dollar \nclimate events, as tracked by the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration, keeps rising, with events again \nprojected to near record levels this year. Compounding the \nhuman\tand\tfinancial\ttolls\tis\tthat\tso\tmuch\trecent\tmigration \t\nhas concentrated in relatively high-risk areas.\nAnd as Hurricane Helene painfully demonstrated in \nSeptember 2024, almost nowhere is totally safe. The storm \ndevastated communities like Asheville, North Carolina, \ncommonly viewed as \u201cclimate havens\u201d relatively immune \nfrom climate risks. But if no place is truly climate-proof, \nsome places are\u2014without doubt\u2014more vulnerable than \nothers. The 2024 Realtor.com Housing and Climate Risk \nReport found that about 45 percent of homes nationwide \nare at risk from at least one type of severe or extreme \nclimate\trisk,\tprimarily\theat\tbut\talso\tincluding\twind,\twildfire,\t\nand\tflood,\twith\tmany\thomes\tat\trisk\tfor\tmultiple\tthreats.\tInsurance costs are soaring in many markets, while millions \nof properties are so vulnerable that they cannot secure \nprivate insurance at all and must rely on state-run insurance. \nBuilding in these high-risk areas also costs more to make \nthem more resilient. Homebuyers are taking notice. Major \nonline\tlisting\tservices\tlike\tZillow\tand\tRedfin\tnow\tprovide\t\nclimate risk data on their listings. According to Zillow, 80 \npercent of homebuyers now consider climate risk when \npurchasing a home.\nIt\u2019s not just homes, of course. Many commercial properties \nare also vulnerable, and insurance premiums are soaring, \nparticularly on apartments in Florida and California, but \nincreasingly in other states and for other property types. While \nless direct, these risks could also help slow future migration to \nthe Sunbelt and other places more vulnerable to climate risks.\nThe economist Milton Friedman famously claimed, \u201cOnly a \ncrisis\u2014actual or perceived\u2014produces real change.\u201d Recent \ndevastating\thurricanes\tand\twildfires\tare\tdemonstrating\t\nthat regardless of one\u2019s politics or beliefs about the causes \nof\tclimate\tchange,\tthe\tcosts\tand\trisks\tare\ttoo\tsignificant\t\nto\u00a0ignore.\nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 202525\nChapter 1: The Time Has ComeHeadlines\tfilled\twith\trecord-breaking\theat\tfigure\tlarge\tin \t\ncoverage of climate change. The opposite side of the coin\u2014\nextreme cold\u2014is a lesser-known hazard that is also on the \nrise, and it is affecting markets not previously challenged by \ncold snaps.\nWinter storm Uri, which brought devastation to Texas in \n2021, is one of the best-known examples of a cold snap \nhitting a warm region. Thus far the world\u2019s costliest winter \nstorm on record, Uri brought over $30 billion in damage , \nknocked out the power grid for millions of people for \ndays, led to 246 deaths\u2014more than Hurricane Sandy  in \n2012\u2014and caused water pipes to freeze and burst in many \nbuildings. Over 500,000 insurance claims \twere\tfiled. \t\nHowever, Uri was far from an isolated incident. As of early \n2024, \u201cOf the nine most recent catastrophic freeze events, \neight of them occurred in California, Florida, or other \nsouthern climates, mostly in areas south of the 32-degree \nfrost line in the International Building Code,\u201d according to \nChuck Miccolis, a building resilience expert. Far from being a\tquiet\tseason\tbetween\thurricanes\tand\twildfires,\twinter \t\nand its associated hazards \u201ccan be one of the highest-risk \nseasons for businesses.\u201d Losses from these events are \nnot cheap, either. \u201cOver the last decade, commercial losses \nfrom winter weather in the U.S. have averaged about $4 \nbillion dollars per year,\u201d says Miccolis. \nWhy is this happening? Anne Waple, a former director at the \nU.S. National Climate Assessment at the National Oceanic \nand Atmospheric Administration, notes that \u201cwarming in the \nArctic is potentially destabilizing the jet stream to the extent \nthat we could see more incursions of extreme cold and \npolar vortexes. [Temperatures] are warmer than they used \nto be, and winter will be warmer overall, but we could still \nhave more of those extreme cold events.\u201d \nThis\ttrend\thas\tsignificant\timplications\tfor\tbuildings\tin \t\nregions not historically accustomed to extreme cold. Rose \nGrant has expertise in both architecture and insurance and \nputs it this way: \u201cBuilding codes use historical models. They \nsay, \u2018this is the kind of snow and these are the weights Surprising Risk of a Warming Climate: Extreme Cold \nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 202526\nwe\u2019ve had for the last 100 years.\u2019 What we\u2019re seeing with \nclimate change is that those backward-looking models \nare not necessarily telling us everything we need to know \nmoving forward as the climate is changing.\u201d\nAs a result, buildings designed only to code (and their \noccupants) in southern locales are at much higher risk of \nexperiencing major damage, for example from collapsed \nroofs or burst water pipes. Energy grids in these regions \nare also typically not weatherized for colder temperatures \nand can experience major outages during cold snaps and \nsnowstorms, putting occupants in danger.\nHow\thas\tthe\tindustry\tresponded?\tAs\tfirms\tbegin\tto \t\nintegrate climate risk into decision-making, extreme \ncold is starting to appear in risk assessments. Some \ndevelopers have already implemented a robust physical risk \nassessment\tand\tmanagement\tstrategy,\tincluding\tfinancial \t\nmodeling.\tOne\tfirm,\twhen\tlooking\tat\tmarkets\taround\tthe \t\ncountry for expansion of its workforce housing investment \nmanagement\tplatform,\twas\tsurprised\tto\tfind\tred\tflag\trisks \t\nfrom extreme cold in traditionally warm markets. \u201cOne \nof the things that jumped out to us in the analysis was \nthat some warmer markets where we didn\u2019t expect it had \nsignificant\tclimate\trisk\u2014both\tfrom\theat\tand\tfrom\tcold,\u201d \t\naccording\tto\tAJ\tJackson,\ta\tleader\tat\tthe\tfirm. \t\nWhat stood out most of all, Jackson notes, was the \n\u201cvulnerability of infrastructure. Coupled with the increasing \nfrequency\tof\textreme\tcold\tevents\tand\tflash\tfreezes,\tit \t\ncreated a situation where there was much more climate \nrisk in some warm markets than we had anticipated.\u201d After \nreviewing the analysis, \u201cthe upshot was that it informed \nhow we think about whether or not we\u2019re going to enter \na market and if so, the types of assets that we want to \nacquire, and what the resilience is at the asset level to \nextreme cold.\u201d\nAt the property level, real estate developers, owners, and \ninvestors have begun to act to reduce their risks from \nextreme cold. For example, a large investment manager \nwith a property in Texas saw a million dollars in damage \nfrom a cold snap in 2022. Pipes burst and caused \u201cmassive \ndisruption to property operations and overall business \ncontinuity,\u201d with tenant amenities closed for nearly nine \nmonths. As a result, this manager chose to upgrade \ninsulation in every building. The company mapped out and focused on the locations \nof exposed pipes that are vulnerable (usually in attics or \nfacing exterior walls). These mitigation measures were \nrelatively low-cost for a property of its size\u2014an easy choice \ngiven the huge impact of possible recurring freeze damage. \nWhile there are no guarantees the insulation will completely \nprevent all future issues, it is expected to minimize potential \ndamage and operational impact. \nOther steps can include providing backup power, installing \nfreeze protection for plumbing, and developing a business \ncontinuity plan for the property. \n\u2014Adapted from ULI Greenprint, Cold Snap: Extreme Cold \nand Real Estate \nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 202527\nChapter 1: The Time Has ComeMany Solutions, No Answers \nWhen evil spirits returned to invade her family\u2019s home \nagain, the little girl in the Poltergeist  sequel famously \nwarned,\t\u201cThey\u2019re\tbaaaaack!\u201d\tIn\ta\tsimilarly\thorrifying\tway, \t\n\u201chousing costs and availability\u201d returned as the top social/\npolitical issue in this year\u2019s Emerging Trends  survey, topping \n\u201cpolitical extremism\u201d and \u201cimmigration policy\u201d by wide \nmargins. Housing affordability was also very much on the \nminds of many of the industry leaders interviewed for this \nreport. Thus, it returns as a top trend for the 2025 edition of \nEmerging Trends , as it has for eight years running. \nYet the national housing affordability crisis\u2014er, condition\u2014\ncontinues to deepen and intensify. Here is how bad housing \naffordability has become: it has emerged as a prominent \nissue\tin\tthe\tU.S.\tpresidential\telection\tfor\tthe\tfirst\ttime\tin \t\nmemory, maybe since the end of World War II. Both major-\nparty candidates are highlighting the issue in their speeches \nand platforms and proposing measures to improve the \nsituation (albeit using diametrically opposed approaches). \nGiven what was said in our industry interviews, American \nsociety does not seem willing to accept the issue to persist \nas just an ongoing condition. \nWhile the growing attention is welcome, prospects for \nimprovements still seem bleak, particularly in the near term. \nAs\tthe\tchief\tinvestment\tofficer\tof\ta\tmajor\tCRE\tinvestment \t\nmanagement\tfirm\tsaid,\t\u201cWe\thave\ta\tpronounced\thousing \t\nshortage in the United States, which is hard to imagine \nhow it\u2019s going to go away. There\u2019s only really one way to \nsolve that problem, which is to build. But it\u2019s hard to see \nhow that\u2019s going to happen. That doesn\u2019t bode well for \naffordability, but it does bode well for rental housing versus \nownership housing, absent all-of-a-sudden loosening of \ncredit standards.\u201d \nWorrying Trends for Homebuying \nHousing affordability remains near all-time lows as home \nprices continue to set record highs. The average home price \nnationally is about 50 percent higher than at the onset of the \npandemic, more than twice the increase in median worker \nearnings. The Wall Street Journal  estimates that nearly 10 \npercent\tof\thomes\thave\tan\testimated\tvalue\tof\t$1\u202fmillion\u202for\t\nmore, more than double the 4 percent share recorded before\tthe\tpandemic.\tNot\tlong\tago,\ta\u202fmillion\tdollars\twas\t\na\tshorthand\tbenchmark\tfor\tluxury\thousing,\tbut\tthat\tfigure\t\nnow represents merely an entry point in many markets. \nMortgage rates are even more problematic for homebuyers. \nMortgage rates remain stubbornly high, even though they \nare beginning to edge down. Although well off their peaks \nregistered\tin\tthe\tfall\tof\t2023,\twhen\t30-year\tfixed-rate \t\nmortgages were nearly 8 percent, rates are still some two-\nthirds higher than in early 2020 before the pandemic. \nTrend #5:Emerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 202528In an ironic and unfortunate twist, the Fed\u2019s effort to bring \ndown\tinflation\targuably\tcompounded\tthe\tproblem.\tFirst, \t\nthe high interest rates brought the home resale market to a \nvirtual standstill. Homeowners stopped putting their homes \nup for sale because they would lose their low-interest \nmortgages. Housing turnover and the available inventory \nboth plunged, driving up prices still further for the few \navailable homes. \nHigh interest rates also helped drive up construction \ncosts on new units, discouraging new home production. \nDeliveries of single-family homes remain well below their \nlong-term average and well below the level needed to keep \npace with household growth. The anemic pace of units \nstarted means the pipeline of new deliveries will not be \nincreasing anytime soon. \nFinally,\tthe\tFed\tgauges\tinflation\twith\ta\tmetric\tthat \t\nincludes an imputed homeowners\u2019 cost, called owners\u2019 \nequivalent rent (OER). For technical reasons, OER is a \nlagging indicator, so the Fed relied on outdated data for \nan expense that homeowners do not even actually pay\u2014\nit\u2019s\timputed!\t Thus,\tmany\teconomists\targue\tthat\tthe \tFed \t\nnot only exacerbated affordability but also prolonged the \nmisery\tsince\tthe\tinflation\tgauge\tthat\texcludes\tOER\thad \t\ncome down to the Fed\u2019s target long ago. With the expenses \nassociated with operating a home\u2014including insurance, \nheat, and maintenance\u2014also rising faster than earnings, it\u2019s \nno wonder that affordability has fallen to historic lows. \nBetter Trends for Renters \nThough the U.S. homeownership rate now surpasses the \nlevel immediately preceding the pandemic, it is still well \nbelow the rates recorded in the years before the global \nfinancial\tcrisis\t(GFC)\tand\thas\tbeen\tfalling\tsince\tlate\t2022. \t\nThe steep rise in the cost of purchasing a home has kept \nmany households renting, by either choice or necessity. \nRents jumped sharply in the years following the pandemic \nas the number of renter-occupied units in the country rose \nfar faster than population growth. Rent growth averaged \nalmost 5 percent annually nationwide from 2019 to \n2023\u2014not nearly as much as the spike in home prices, but \nsubstantially more than income growth. \nAs noted in the supply trend (Building Boom, Tenant Boon) \nand the chapter 2 multifamily overview, the apartment \nmarket dynamics are changing thanks to an unprecedented \nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 202529\nChapter 1: The Time Has Comeburst of new supply coming to market. Excluding the \nunusual circumstances of the lockdown, rents are falling for \nthe\tfirst\ttime\tsince\tthe\thousing\tmarket\tcollapsed\tin\tthe\tGFC.\t\nWith record completions this year, rents should continue to \ntrend down, but the gains for renters have been modest. \nEven with these slight declines, the U.S. Census Bureau \ncalculates that almost half of renter households are \nconsidered \u201ccost-burdened,\u201d spending more than 30 percent \nof their income to keep a roof over their heads. Worse, an \nunconscionable quarter of renters pay at least half of their \nincome on rent. Not only does this high rent burden leave \nlittle for groceries and other necessities; it effectively locks \nhouseholds into renting permanently because they cannot \nsave for a downpayment. \nGetting to Yes \nAs\tthe\tchief\tinvestment\tofficer\tquoted\tabove\tput\tit,\tthe \t\nsimple solution to address affordability is to build more \nhousing. A consultant to housing developers adds, \u201cSupply \nand demand does work. The ability for us to add supply \nto housing is the single most important thing that we can \ndo to control escalating unaffordability\u2014wherever that \nhousing is added on the spectrum. It\u2019s not just adding \nmore affordable housing, although that\u2019s important, but \nadding\thousing\tperiod\tcreates\ta\tfiltering.\u201d\t(Filtering\tis\tthe \t\nprocess through which older housing stock becomes more \naffordable as it is sold by owners who move into newer, \nmore modern housing stock introduced into the market.) \nThis critical insight is not new. However, years of declining \naffordability demonstrate that this solution is much easier \nsaid than done. Local regulations and delays remain the \nbiggest impediments to supplying developed land to \nhomebuilders. In response, governments, builders, and \nhousing advocates are advancing a variety of approaches. \n\u2022 Tweaking zoning and environmental regulations:  \nMore states and local governments are experimenting \nwith eliminating single-family zoning, raising the \npotential for denser neighborhoods and more \naffordable units.  \n \nThe Twin Cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis, Minnesota, \nprovide an outstanding example of contrasting \napproaches to making housing more affordable. In \nrecent years, Minneapolis adopted various measures to increase the production of higher-density housing, while \nSt. Paul opted to rely on rent control. One interviewee, \na CRE economist, said, \u201cIt\u2019s a great natural experiment \nwhere you get these two cities right next to each other. \nMinneapolis got rid of single-family zoning and allowed \nthe market to deliver what the market wanted, at least \nto some degree. And rent growth was more muted \nduring that period than in St. Paul.\u201d Indeed, Minneapolis \nis\tenjoying\ta\tsignificant\texpansion\tin\tmultifamily\t\nprojects that are adding hundreds of new units, while \nhousing production has slowed markedly in St. Paul.  \n \nIn California, where more than 95 percent of residential \nland is zoned exclusively for single-family homes, the \nstate legislature enacted a bill in 2021 allowing for lot \nsplitting. The law\u2019s future is uncertain as a judge ruled \nit unconstitutional early in 2024. However, California\u2019s \nAssembly Bill 2011, which took effect in 2023, provides \nfor easier and expedited approval for affordable and \nmixed-use housing on commercially zoned land.  \n \nMany states have relaxed restrictions against \nAccessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) including California, \nMontana, Washington, and New York, among others. \nSometimes called granny flats , ADUs are small \nresidences situated on the same lot as the primary \ndwelling. These units offer distinct living spaces \nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 202530\nseparate from the main house, enabling homeowners \nto offer housing to family members or tenants. ADUs \nhelp expand housing options, thereby enhancing the \navailability of affordable living arrangements. \n\u2022 Smaller homes: Another approach to bring down costs \nis to make houses smaller, and that is also happening. \nThe Census Bureau reports that the median size of \nsingle-family homes has been trending down since \n2015 and now is at its lowest average since 2010, \ndropping 355 square feet to 2,164 square feet. The \nNational Association of Home Builders expects the \ntrend to continue. The association reports that over \none-third of U.S. homebuilders decreased the size of \nthe homes they built in 2023, and a quarter anticipate \nconstructing even smaller homes this year.  \n \nStill, the counter \u201cMcMansionization\u201d trend also \ncontinues and plays a role in reducing the availability of \nsmaller affordable homes. A study by the Metropolitan \nAbundance Project, for example, found that over one-\nthird (37 percent) of new single-family homes built in \nLos Angeles County in 2020 were more than 3,400 \nsquare feet, and the proportion reaches two-thirds in \nmore\taffluent\tcities,\twith\tboth\tfigures\tup\tsignificantly\tin \t\nrecent decades.  \n \nThe reality is that the high cost of permitting and the \nextended time required to secure approvals incentivize \ndevelopers to build at higher price points to recover \ntheir investments. Said one developer, \u201cEither you\u2019re \nbuilding larger housing for fewer and fewer people \nthat can afford housing, or you\u2019re shrinking the size\u2014\nbecause when you\u2019re building housing, it\u2019s chunk price, \nnot price per foot. And [that\u2019s] why townhomes are so \npopular.\u201d \n\u2022 OK, boomers: Another huge opportunity is providing \noptions for the enormous number of baby boomers \nwho will soon need housing to age into (see the \ndiscussion in chapter 2). In many markets, seniors \nhave few options beyond aging in place. That works \nfor some healthy seniors, but many need housing that \ncomes with graduated care. \u201cThe housing stock should \nbe turning over more than it does here,\u201d said one \ndeveloper. \u201cWe don\u2019t produce enough of it. We don\u2019t \nhave places for people to age down into.\u201d A National Problem \nHousing\taffordability\tis\tno\tlonger\tconfined\tto\tlarge\tcoastal \t\ncities. Virtually every metro area in the country is suffering \nfrom a shortage of affordable for-sale and rental housing. \nWith the problem so widespread, the issue can no longer be \ntackled locally but requires a national approach. \nAs\talready\tnoted,\tpoliticians\tare\tfinally\ttaking\tnotice,\tand \t\nboth major-party presidential candidates are proposing \npolicies to expand the supply and bring down costs. One \nwants to build 3 million new housing units by providing \nsubsidies for homebuilders and buyers. The other wants \nto expand production through deregulation and by making \nfederal land available for housing construction. Both parties \nalso want to reduce some types of housing demand to free \nup homes for others. The Democrats want to limit investor \npurchases of single-family homes. The Republicans want \nto restrict the ability of undocumented immigrants to buy or \nrent homes. \nThere is no shortage of solutions, as we have outlined here \nand in prior editions of Emerging Trends . The answer seems \nto depend more on summoning the collective will to get \nthings done. \nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 202531\nChapter 1: The Time Has ComeThe\tYear-End\t2023\tGlobal\tPropTech\tConfidence\tIndex \t\nrevealed a measured resurgence in industry sentiment, \ndeparting from 2022\u2019s record lows. Throughout 2024, \nboth property technology (PropTech) entrepreneurs \nand investors have continued to signal stabilization, in \nline with the cautiously active sentiment of the global \nmacroeconomic\tenvironment.\u00a0\n Investment activity in the early-and-late-stage venture \ncapital\tmarkets\thas\tbegun\tto\tpick\tup\tsignificantly\tin \t\nresponse to a recalibration of pricing expectations and \nimprovements in deal quality. According to the Global \nPropTech\tConfidence\tIndex,\t77\tpercent\tof\tsurveyed \t\ninvestors plan to maintain or increase their investments \nin PropTech over the next 12 months. And although the \nwindow for initial public offerings remains tepid for now, \nPropTech mergers and acquisition activity continues to be \nstrong\tfor\tboth\tstrategic\tand\tfinancial\tbuyers.\tA \tsubstantial \t\n87 percent of investors surveyed expect the volume of \nPropTech mergers and acquisitions to either remain steady \nor\tincrease\tover\tthe\tnext\tyear.\u00a0\nBeyond macroeconomic tailwinds, a combination of \ntechnology breakthroughs, evolving regulatory frameworks, \nand ongoing litigation will continue to reshape the PropTech \nlandscape. This section explores three key trends driving \ngrowth and innovation in the industry heading into 2025:\n1. Refinement, Targeted Application, and Bottom-\nline Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence in \nCommercial Real Estate\nOver the past year, the excitement surrounding the potential \nof\tgenerative\tartificial\tintelligence\t(AI)\thas\tresulted\tin\tan \t\nover-rotation of capital and founders into the category, \nboth chasing the trend of the moment. Following an initial \nrush to stake a claim in this new frontier, the landscape \nis now maturing, and the frenzy is beginning to temper. \nEven AI-focused investors are becoming more discerning. \nCoinciding with this temperature shift has been the initial \nemergence of select generative AI applications, which are \ndriving\tthe\treturn\ton\tinvestment.\u00a0The\tfollowing\tfive\tareas\t(in\tno\tparticular\torder)\tare \t\nreceiving the most focus:\n\u2022 The structuring and use of data stored in documents \nthrough\tdocument\tabstraction\u00a0\n\u2022 Property marketing tools for generating listings, \npersonalized walkthroughs, staged images, space \nplans,\tand\twritten\tcampaigns\u00a0\n\u2022 AI chatbots that drive improved communication, tour \nscheduling, lead processing, and continued tenant \nengagement\tfor\tproperty\tsales\tand\tleasing\u00a0\n\u2022 The transformation of the request-for-proposal \nprocess through analysis and use of historical bid data \nto\tgenerate\tnew\tdocumentation\u00a0\n\u2022 Improved market analysis and feasibility through site \nintelligence and automatically generated massing \nmodels\tand\thigh-level\tdesign\tschemes\u00a0\nMany of real estate\u2019s inherent characteristics\u2014data-rich \nenvironment, process-intensive operations, regulatory \ncomplexity, and need for personalization\u2014make the \nindustry particularly ripe for advanced AI integration. As \nthe industry continues to evaluate and implement these \napplications, awareness of the tangible, bottom-line \nimpacts is expected to grow. \n2. Industry Alignment of Environmental, Social, and \nGovernance Initiatives with Regulatory Requirements\u00a0\nMany\tcorporate\tbudgets\thave\ttightened\tsignificantly\tsince \t\n2021, leading to decreased emphasis on environmental, \nsocial, and governance (ESG) or climate-related initiatives. \nHowever, even in the context of constrained corporate \nbudgets, ESG initiatives can drive focused investments in \ncarbon\temissions\tquantification,\tdisclosure\tcompliance, \t\nand\tbuilding\tretrofits.\tSectors\tand\tregions\tthat\tare\tfacing \t\nregulatory pressure have displayed continued diligence. \nFor example, companies affected by California\u2019s and the \nSecurity and Exchange Commission\u2019s climate disclosure PropTech\u2019s Impact on Real Estate Innovation and TransformationEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 202532\nrules are actively collecting and reporting the required \ndata. In these relevant markets, the desire to adopt \nexisting technology solutions appears mixed. While some \ncompanies are using technology to streamline their data \ncollection, quality assurance, and reporting, others are still \nchoosing\tto\tprocess\ttheir\tworkflows,\tpiecemeal,\tin-house. \t\nThe solution space will likely continue to mature in line with \nthe regulatory landscape.\n3. Heightened Focus around Residential Real Estate\u2019s \nCommission Structures\nIn the midst of a challenging residential real estate market \nand a temporary oversupply in the multifamily market, the \npriority has been to serve and protect buyers and tenants. \nAt the same time, consumers are demanding greater \ntransparency\tand\tefficiency\tin\tcommission\tstructures.\t The \t\nresult could be a paradigm shift.\nIn August, the U.S. Department of Justice announced \na lawsuit against a PropTech giant, alleging that the \ncompany\u2019s revenue management algorithm enables \ncollusion among residential landlords and property \nmanagers, driving up rents unnecessarily for millions of Americans. While this case is expected to drag on for \nyears in the legal system, its implications for the broader \nPropTech\tecosystem\tare\texpected\tto\tbe\tsubstantial.\u00a0\nAdditionally, in August, new regulations concerning \nreal estate agent behavior went into effect, following a \nsettlement between a leading real estate industry group \nand various class-action lawsuits related to commission \nstructure collusion. Under the new regulations, buyers must \nnegotiate payment with their agents before engaging in the \nhome-showing process. Moreover, buyer\u2019s agents are no \nlonger allowed to receive compensation from the seller\u2019s \nagent without prior negotiation. This mandate may lead \nsome potential buyers to forego working with an agent \naltogether.\u00a0\nIn\tthe\tfirst\tsituation,\tfirms\tinvolved\tin\tthird-party\tdata \t\nsharing are likely to tighten their belts. In the second, \na slew of promising new startups can be expected to \ndevelop technology to streamline various aspects of the \nhomebuying process, potentially mitigating reliance on real \nestate agents. Both developments are worth watching.\n\u2014MetaProp\nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 202533\nChapter 1: The Time Has ComeIssues to Watch: Heightened \nUncertainty \nThe CRE industry is more optimistic now than a year ago, but \nit is not without worry. While risk is ever-present in investment \nmarkets, a heightened level of uncertainty now pervades \nindustry outlooks. Yet, if there is broad agreement on the \nkey risks, there is a wider variety of perspectives on how \nconcerned we should be. \nTwo sources of uncertainty dominated our discussions with \nindustry leaders: the upcoming U.S. election and geopolitical risk. \nWith wars raging in Ukraine and the Middle East, people fear that \nthe\t conflicts\t could\t spread\t to\tinvolve\t more\t countries,\t potentially \t\neven drawing the United States into the clashes directly\u2014with \nunknown but alarming consequences. People also worry about \nthe impact on global trade and petroleum prices, which could \nreignite\tinflation\tor\ttip\tthe\teconomy\tinto\ta\trecession. \t\nThen there\u2019s the federal elections that will be held in early \nNovember, a few days after this report is published. As the \nnewly elected President Barack Obama famously told the other \nparty\u2019s leadership, \u201cElections have consequences.\u201d \nBut not always. The ability of the incoming administration \nto implement policy depends partly on having a governing \ncoalition. While the election outcome is still very much \nuncertain as of this writing, the consensus among most people \nwe interviewed is that neither party is likely to sweep all three \nbranches of the federal government. Thus, people expect a \nsplit government in which neither party gets all it wants. \nAnd real estate is ultimately a local business, so \u201cpolitically, \npeople \tare\tmore\tfocused\ton\tspecific\tpolicies\tin\ttheir\tcities\tand \t\ncounties and even states, and less worried about what the \noutcome is at the federal level,\u201d said the head of an investment \nbank serving the CRE sector. \nStill, there is much at stake at the federal level for the CRE \nindustry. The two competing parties have very different \napproaches to issues such as immigration, regulation, the \nenvironment and climate change, and monetary policy, to \nname just a few. A split government also raises the risk of a \ngovernment after shutdown or even credit default if the parties \ncannot\tagree\ton\tmeasures\tto\tfinance\tthe\tgovernment\twhen \t\nthe continuing resolution extending the budget debt ceiling \nexpires on January 1, 2025. Then the Treasury Department \nwould\tneed\tto\tadopt\textraordinary\tfinancing\tmeasures\tonce \t\nagain to temporarily keep the federal government open until \nthe\tmoney\tfinally\truns\tout\tsometime\tin\tmid-2025.The industry is also thinking about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act \nof 2017 (TCJA), which is due to expire in 2025\u2014with potential \ntax consequences for real estate owners and investors \ndepending on what provisions, if any, are extended. Not \neveryone is worried, though. One prominent developer said, \u201cI \ndon\u2019t think it\u2019ll matter that much. A lot of the assets in place \nright now have a relatively high basis, so if you sell something, \nyou\tdon\u2019t\thave \ta\treal\tprofit\tin\tit.\tIt\tsort\tof\tdoesn\u2019t\tmatter\twhat \t\nthe\ttax\tbenefits\tare.\u201d\tOf\tcourse,\tthe\timpacts\twould\tbe\tmuch \t\ngreater for the many investors who bought years ago at a \nlower\tbasis\tand\thave\tunrealized\tconsiderable\tprofits. \t\nRegardless of the election outcome, the industry will just be \nrelieved to move beyond the campaign season. An investment \nmanager leader said, \u201cI think the election is probably putting \nan extra pall of uncertainty on things and getting that in the \nrearview mirror will probably help a little bit.\u201d \nBy the time you read this, the election outcome may well \nhave already been decided\u2014or not, if history repeats and the \nelection is contested. There is even a non-zero risk that the \nnation will not agree on the election outcome before the next \npresident is scheduled to be inaugurated on January 20, 2025. \nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 20253434Emerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 2025 34Emerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 202535\nProperty Type Outlook\nIndustry\tleaders\tare\tmore\tconfident\tthan\ta\tyear\tago,\tthough \t\nthey remain watchful for the right time for the right asset. \nKey to laying the groundwork for the next few years is the \nclarity that property markets are no longer undergoing the \nsudden shifts in how tenants use space as we saw during and \nimmediately after the pandemic. Investors are now shifting \ntheir attention to cyclical issues, such as the recent excess \nin supply, and adapting to the developing tastes, needs, and \nstrategies of consumers and tenants. \nOne exception to cyclical changes is the rise of data center \ndemand,\tdue\tto\tthe\tmassive\texpansion\tof\tartificial\tintelligence \t\nthroughout almost every facet of our economy. Other niche \nand alternative property types are experiencing strong growth, \nas well, although not in the same explosive manner. \nThe property type ratings reported in this year\u2019s Emerging \nTrends  survey illustrate how cyclical issues, the robustness \nof long-term demand, and the growing importance of data \ncenters, along with other specialized or alternative property \nsectors,\tare\tinfluencing\tthe\tmarket.\tOn\tone\thand,\tthe\taverage \t\nrating of core property types\u2014industrial, single-family, \nmultifamily,\thotels,\tretail,\tand\toffice\u2014in\t Emerging Trends  \n2025 is up just 1.5 percent over last year\u2019s average although \nit exceeds the average rating in the Emerging Trends  survey \ncompleted in 2019, just before the pandemic, by almost 4 \npercent, while the gap between the highest- and lowest-rated \ncore sectors is narrowing very slightly, back on par with the \ngap in that prepandemic survey. What has changed in the individual core sectors? The industrial \nsector is the highest-rated core property type in this year\u2019s \nsurvey, with a slightly stronger rating than last year\u2019s; still, \nthis year\u2019s score is slightly lower than its pandemic peak. \nBoth single-family and multifamily housing sectors remain \nstrong, but ratings are slightly below last year\u2019s, and they now \ncome in at second and third place, respectively. Collectively, \nthese\tslight\tmovements\treflect\tthe\tinterplay\tof\tthe\tindustry\u2019s \t\nfocus on the longer-term strength of demand, nearer-term \nanticipated movement in interest rates, current oversupply \nin some sectors, and the understanding of tenants\u2019 and \nconsumers\u2019 needs and interests. \u201cOur\tfirm\tis\tmore\toptimistic\tbut\tcautious,\tfocusing\ton\tstability\t\npostpandemic. Still, the rise in niche property type  demand \nand growth highlights the market\u2019s dynamic nature.\u201d \nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 202536Hotels and retail, on the other hand, although rated fourth and \nfifth\tof\tthe\tcore\tproperty\ttypes,\trespectively,\tshowed\tstronger\t\nmovement upward, with ratings this year at their highest since \nEmerging Trends \u2019 prepandemic year.

While the highest-rated core sector is industrial \ninvestment prospects, data centers are rated the highest among the \nalternative, niche, and other subsectors, with a score 13 percent above \nthat of industrial. Additionally, this year\u2019s data center rating shows \na 5 percent improvement over its top rating in last year\u2019s survey. \nFurther, three other noncore subsectors are rated slightly higher \nthan the industrial core sector\u2014senior housing, neighborhood \nand community shopping centers, and manufacturing\u2014and \nratings\tof\twarehouse,\tflex,\tand\tfulfillment\tsubsectors\tare\tabout\t\nthe same as the overall core industrial sector, suggesting the \nbroad strength of that sector. Interestingly, the life sciences subsector, included in the \nEmerging Trends  survey starting only three years ago, was \ninitially rated higher than this year\u2019s industrial core rating. \nSentiment results for life sciences have since declined by 11 \npercent, although a further look ahead at the dynamics in this \nsector suggest growth is on the horizon. \nWith\tthese\tobservations,\twe\tspotlight\tfive\tsignificant\tproperty \t\ntrends in this chapter, in addition to discussing the broader \nlandscape of core proper ty types and alternatives. \nTrend 1 \u2013 Industrial Smart Growth: The Next Stage of Tactical \nNetwork Optimization \nTrend 2 \u2013 Data Centers: Navigating Power Constraints and \nSkyrocketing Demand \nTrend 3 \u2013 Senior Housing: Building New Muscles \nTrend 4 \u2013 Retail Resilience: Weathering Every Storm \nTrend 5 \u2013 Innovating the Suburbs: Is Life Sciences\u2019 Growth \nSustainable?\nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 2025 37Chapter 2: Property Type Outlook\nIndustrial Smart Growth: The \nNext Stage of Tactical Network \nOptimization \n\u2022 Industrial real estate tenants are employing a new \nsmart-growth strategy for the next phase of leasing, \nplacing greater emphasis on asset selection for \nwarehouse space when considering future expansions. \n\u2022 Infrastructure requirements for logistics real estate have \nexpanded to include high power availability, automation \ncapabilities, and sustainable building features. \n\u2022 Supply\tnetwork\tdiversification,\tincluding\tthrough \t\nnearshoring and onshoring of operations, has become \na key driver of location selection for industrial users. \nLogistics real estate is entering a new phase of growth \nafter years of volatility, one focused on smart-growth \ndecision-making to optimize supply chains, circumvent \ndisruption, and stand the test of time. During the pandemic, \ncompanies aggressively expanded their footprints to meet \nsoaring consumer demand. The past two years have seen \na reversal, with leasing activity slowing as the market saw \nan\tinflux\tof\thigh-quality\tsupply.\tIn\t2025,\tthe\tnew\tphase \twill \t\nmerge elements of both periods: more high-quality options \nfor customers pursuing a strategic, deliberate approach to \ngrowth that will shape the future of the supply chain. \nIn 2023 and 2024, companies delayed decision-making on \nexpansion plans amid high economic uncertainty and cost \nchallenges. As a result, new demand is expected to return \nin 2025 with the added layer of supply chain optimization \nguiding growth strategies. \nCompanies are increasingly involving more stakeholders \nin their decision-making and reevaluating business models \nwith a closer eye. C-suite executives and supply chain \nconsultants have become more involved with day-to-\nday leasing, leading to extended deal-making timelines. \nAccording to an industrial real estate leasing expert, \nactivity will be picking up into 2025 but not as sharply \nas originally expected. Instead, industrial market users \nwill continue to adopt tactical approaches to their supply \nnetwork reorganization and work toward optimizing costs through the uncertain economic landscape. The result \nis a deliberate and tactical approach to leasing to best \nincrease revenues, optimize expenditures, and maximize \nthe company\u2019s resources. \nIn\tthe\tfirst\thalf\tof\t2024,\tthe\tUnited\tStates\trecorded \t\naround 80 million square feet of net absorption, a 37 \npercent decline from the same period in 2023. Meanwhile, \naccording to CBRE, leasing activity nationwide\u2014a leading \nindicator of net absorption\u2014grew 5 percent during the \nsame period. This pickup of deal making is partially a \nresponse to rental rate declines in most markets that \noptimize opportunities for industrial tenants. \nProperty Trend #1The industrial development cycle tells another story, one \nof a rebalancing to match this new demand trajectory. \nNew construction starts continued to fall in 2024, with \nspeculative development starts decreasing by 43 percent \nin\tthe\tfirst\thalf\tof\tthe\tyear\tcompared\tto\tthe\tsame\tperiod\tin \t\n2023. Additionally, a further decline of 20 percent for the \nentirety of 2025 is projected when compared to the peak \nground-breaking volume of 2023. New supply availability \nis expected to rebalance in 2025 as developers adopt a \nmore disciplined approach to development. When the \nexpected increase in leasing activity comes into play next \nyear, industrial users will have a broad range of high-quality, \nmodern facilities to choose from\u2014mainly in the expanding \nSunbelt region\u2014as smart-growth strategies continue \nto\u00a0expand. \t\nSupply Chain Diversification to Drive Decision-making \nin\u00a02025 \nAs trade relationships continue to evolve globally, \nexpansions of real estate footprints, to mitigate risks and \nmove goods closer to the end consumer, will continue. \nThis trend is apparent in developments of manufacturing \nfacilities in markets like Mexico and India to reduce reliance \non a single point of origin for inventory. In 2023, Mexico \nsaw a 27 percent increase in foreign direct investment, and \ndemand in Mexican border markets remains approximately \ndouble prepandemic levels. This rapid acceleration \nis driven by continued nearshoring and onshoring \nmanufacturing growth. In 2025, efforts to optimize supply \nchains\twill\temphasize\tincreased\tdiversification.\tChinese \t\nmanufacturers continue to move operations into Mexico as \nborder markets in both the United States and Mexico have \nseen a surge in demand. However, the pace of onshoring \nback to the United States has been slower than anticipated, \nas challenges related to land availability and operational \ncost challenges have risen in the United States. \nAccess to Quality Long-term Infrastructure to Drive \nLeasing Behavior in Next Phase \nIndustrial tenants are not only looking for high-quality modern \nassets to meet their supply chain needs. As they grapple \nwith heightened capital constraints, they are also focusing \non optimizing operating margins, capital outlay, and resource \nneeds. Access to power and water has emerged as a key \nconsideration in leasing needs as occupiers employ more \nenergy-intensive features, including automation, electric \nvehicle capabilities, and industry-based needs for advanced \nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 2025 38Emerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 2025 39Chapter 2: Property Type Outlook\nmanufacturing facilities and data centers. An expert in \nindustrial customer preferences noted that power availability \nis the second-most crucial element in leasing decisions, right \nafter location. In some places, such as California, Phoenix, \nand Nevada, power is already a barrier to move-ins as users \ngrapple with long wait times with utilities and a lack of \nadequate power to conduct operations. As temperatures rise \nin high-demand markets in the southern United States, high \npower temperature control and technologically advanced \nfacilities continue to increase the power needed to fuel \nmodern logistics facilities. Battery and solar capabilities \nhave continued to gain traction in key logistics markets that \nexperience brownouts on a more frequent basis. \nLuckily\tfor\tmost\ttenants,\tthe\tmassive\tinflux\tof\tsupply\tover \t\nthe past year means that those looking for modern building \nfeatures have more high-quality options. The demand \nhas largely moved from built-to-suit properties to existing \ninventories due to the ready availability of speculative \nproducts, though certain tenants with distinct power \nrequirements\tand\tspecific\tsupply\tchain\tneeds\tcontinue \t\nto prioritize custom buildouts. Built-to-suit absorption \nis\tforecast\tto\tfall\t50\tpercent\tin\tthe\tfirst\thalf\tof\t2025\tas \t\nexisting high-quality inventory will satisfy current demand. \nA Major Differentiator for Industrial Users: Technology \nIndustrial owners, investors, and operators investing \nin technology and automation are at the forefront of \nusing\tmodern\ttechnology\tto\timprove \tthe\tefficiency\tand \t\nperformance of supply chain operations. Conventional AI \nis extensively employed across different sectors, especially for customer support automation. For internal warehouse \noperations, adopters focus on optimizing pick stations \nand throughput rates, capitalizing on existing labor, and \nhelping\tincrease \tefficient\toperations.\tAn\tindustrial\treal \t\nestate \tspecialist\tindicated\tthat\tthe\tstaffing\tneeds\tfor \t\nwarehouses\thave\tsurged\tsignificantly\tin\tthe\tpast\tdecade, \t\nespecially within e-commerce operations. Companies are \nnow\tadopting\tquick-fix\tsolutions\u2014such\tas\tautomated \t\nwarehouse robots to transport goods throughout the \nfacility\u2014which\thave\tproven\thighly\tbeneficial\tfor\tboth \t\ne-commerce activities and extensive warehouse spaces.\nSupply chain visualization technology has also continued to \ngain traction, with companies turning predictive models into \npractical solutions for inventory management and accuracy. \nThis strategy has helped companies better understand \nwhere inventory is headed, where it comes from, and how \nbest to utilize their network. Supply chain analysts are \nconstantly monitoring these predictive models relying on \nthis high-quality data. As companies make greater use of \nthese technologies, data integrity is the most crucial factor \nin accurate modeling and the decision-making associated \nwith those predictions. Optimized warehouse and network \ndesign have become crucial, especially for larger, well-funded \ncompanies. These businesses now need advanced solutions \nto manage extensive inventories and complex supply chains \nand\tto\toptimize\ttheir\tfinancial\toverheads. \t\nImportance of Sustainability to Future Supply Chain and \nLong-term Strategy \nIndustrial users are currently developing sustainability \nmeasures with a long-term perspective, assessing \nstrategies that will unfold over several decades. \nEnvironmental initiatives, including net zero goals and \nregulatory measures from local and state governments \nhave continued to drive the timeline on adoption of \nsustainability goals. An estimated 40 percent of industrial \nusers have adopted net zero goals as of 2024, compared to \nless than 10 percent in 2019. Companies are recognizing \nthat with a 10-to-15-year industrial lease, environmental \npolicies need to be implemented soon to meet these \nsustainability goals. Not all industrial users are able to \nadopt these measures in the current market environment; \nbut the value of long-term investments\u2014for example, in \nenvironmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives\u2014is \nquickly\toutweighing\tthe\tshort-term\tcash-flow\tchallenges. \t\nIndustrial Investment Improving alongside Pricing Clarity \nDeal volumes have stabilized in the industrial sector, albeit \nwith\tfluctuations,\tas\tinvestors\tcome\tto\tterms\twith\tthe\tnew \t\ncost of capital. According to a capital market expert, the \nnumber of industrial deals has remained relatively stable, \nshowing improvement when compared to the decline \nobserved in the previous year. In second quarter 2024, high-\nvalue areas with recently sluggish demand (such as Los \nAngeles) experienced the greatest percentage declines in \ntransaction volumes. In contrast, areas with strong market \ndynamics (like Dallas) witnessed the strongest increases in \ntransaction volumes. \nTransaction volumes have remained consistent with \nprepandemic levels, indicating that a new normal \nhas been established within the sector. Cross-border \ninvestors remain active, favoring portfolio and entity \ndeals. Investors continue to view industrial real estate as \na stable long-term asset class due to stronger prospects \nof income growth compared with other real estate \nasset types, higher operating margins, and low capital \nexpenditure\u00a0requirements. \tConclusion \nAs logistics real estate operators grapple with economic \nuncertainty, rising interest rates, and shifting global trade \ndynamics, smart-growth strategies are the story of the next \nphase of the industrial real estate cycle. This next stage \nwill be shaped by the future of supply chains, with a focus \non strategic growth, technological advancements, and \nsustainability initiatives. \nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 2025 40Emerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 2025 41Chapter 2: Property Type Outlook\nData Centers: Navigating Power \nConstraints and Skyrocketing \nDemand\nData centers are a relatively new major property type with ties \nto both infrastructure and net-lease, and they are on a path \nto be one of the largest property types in the country over the \nnext 10 years. Demand is being fueled by numerous drivers, \nincluding\tcloud\tstorage,\tmobile\tdata\ttraffic,\toverall\tinternet \t\ntraffic,\tand\tartificial\tintelligence\t(AI),\tamong\tother\tnew\tand \t\ngrowing uses (e.g., autonomous vehicles). The surge in AI \nis\tnotably\tdriving\ta\tsignificant\tincrease\tin\tthe\tneed\tfor\tdata \t\ncenters and computing capacity. \nWhile demand for data centers is skyrocketing, new supply \nis facing severe constraints mainly due to limits on electric \npower transmission capabilities. The mismatch between \nconstrained supply and strong demand, which is likely \nto\tpersist\tfor\tthe\tnext\tfive\tyears\tor\tmore,\thas\tresulted\tin\t\nvirtually no vacant space in the major data center markets, \nrapidly\trising\trents,\tand\tsuper-charged\tprofits\tfor\tdevelopers\t\nthat can secure access to guaranteed power sources.\nThere are certainly downsides to the rapid expansion of \ndata centers. The pressing need for electricity is causing \nutilities to prolong the use of coal and other carbon-intense \npower plants. New transmission lines are needed in many \ncases, with public opposition a risk. Data center equipment \nneeds to be constantly cooled, often with water that is \nincreasingly scarce in many parts of the country. They \ntend to be noisy and visually unappealing, making them \nunsuitable as neighbors. Data center operators hope to re-\nopen decommissioned nuclear power plants to secure long-\nterm power, raising concerns about safety and spent fuel \ndisposal. Further, certain counties with high concentrations \nof data centers (e.g., Loudoun County, Virginia) have begun \nto discuss legislation that would make new development \nmore\tdifficult,\tpotentially\teven\tdoing\taway\twith\tany\tby-\nright development of land into data centers and requiring \ndiscretionary approval.\nAll in all, the strong business case for data usage (AI is \nforecast to annually generate hundreds of billions in revenue) \nand the potential societal gains (e.g., greater productivity, \nlower fatalities due to autonomous vehicles) mean that data centers will likely continue to expand as fast as power \nsources\tcan\tbe\tprocured\tfor\tthe\tnext\tfive\tto\t10\tyears.\nData Center Typology\nThere are three primary types of data centers:\n\u2022 Enterprise  facilities are wholly built, maintained, \noperated, and managed by companies for the \noptimal operation of their own information \ntechnology\u00a0equipment.\nProperty Trend #2\u2022 Cloud or hyper-scale  facilities are built to \naccommodate the scalable applications revolving \naround the cloud, big data, or distributed storage. They \nare typically single-tenant facilities and/or campuses. \nIncreasingly large, hyper-scale tenants are using these \nfacilities for AI purposes (e.g., large language model \ntraining, inferencing).\n\u2022 Multitenant/colocation/network-dense facilities are \nbuilt to accommodate multiple companies that lease \nspace within the data center. Network-dense facilities \nallow users to interconnect to many different network \nservice providers, enhancing the interconnectivity of \nthe user to other facilities within a market and outside \nthat market.\nA very limited well-known group of hyper-scale tenants \nmake up the bulk of current demand and are projecting \ncontinued and expanded capital spending. Unlike other \nreal estate sectors, data center revenue is usually linked to \npower capacity (kilowatts per month) rather than the size of \nthe building.\nTop Markets\nData centers have historically clustered in areas with good \nconnectivity\tto\tfiber\tand\tnear\tmajor\tpopulation\tcenters.\t\nNorthern Virginia is the leading global data center market \nmainly because it was one of the earliest locations of \nthe internet ecosystem, having proximity to government \nand\tmilitary-focused\tusers,\tdeep\tfiber\toptic\tconnectivity,\ta relative availability of land, and a low risk of natural \ndisasters. Today, approximately 70 percent of world internet \ntraffic\tpasses\tthrough\tdata\tcenters\tin\tthe\tNorthern\tVirginia\t\nregion.\t The\tfigure\toutlines\tthe\tprimary\treasons\tfor\tthe\t\nextremely low vacancy rates and very limited supply pipeline, \nparticularly in the largest markets. The primary markets vary \nin terms of their relative attractiveness. The key qualities of \nan\tattractive\tdata\tcenter\tmarket\tinclude\tthe\u00a0following:\n\u2022 Fiber connectivity\n\u2022 Proximity to a major population base \n\u2022 Government support, such as tax incentives \n\u2022 Power availability and cost \n\u2022 Low risk of disaster or disruption \n\u2022 Low land costs  \nRisks\nIn addition to the specialized skills needed to develop and \noperate data centers, additional risks include the following:\n\u2022 Obsolescence  due to advancements in technology \nis always a possibility. For example, one interviewee \nsuggested that \u201cthere is a 25 percent chance \nof commercially viable and disruptive quantum \ncomputing breakthroughs in the next decade.\u201d\n\u2022 Economies of scale  could reach a level such that \nhyper-scalers\tfind\tit\tmore\tcost\teffective\tto\town\ttheir \t\nown facilities. The current risk is tenant concentration.\n\u2022 Capital expenditures  can be quite high depending \non the level of services provided, although most such \nexpenses are the responsibility of the tenant. Overall \nthe burden of capital expenditures for this property \ntype is generally less than that of other types.\n\u2022 Electric power  for new developments will be \nconstrained for the foreseeable future. Northern \nVirginia and Silicon Valley are two of the most \nconstrained, but many other top tier markets are \nexperiencing power constraints that are leading to wait \ntimes\tof\tfive \tor\tmore\tyears.\n\u2022 Environmental impacts  such as greenhouse gas \nemissions and water usage will grow rapidly as the \nsector expands. The industry is exploring clean energy \n(including nuclear), fuel cell storage, and recycling \nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 2025 42Emerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 2025 43Chapter 2: Property Type Outlook\ndata center equipment, but greater local restrictions \nare\u00a0possible.\n\u2022 Small markets  will come into play as data centers \nincreasingly locate near large power sources- some \nof which are outside of major population centers. \nFor\texample,\ta\tlarge\tsoftware\tfirm\thas\tsigned\tan \t\nagreement to purchase 835 megawatts (MW) of power \nfor 20 years at the to-be-reopened Three Mile Island \nnuclear power plant, to meet its carbon-free energy \ngoals at its nearby data centers. The power plant is in \nHarrisburg, Pennsylvania, a metro area with 570,000 \npeople. Other small markets are similarly being \nexplored due to the availability of power.\nCapital Markets\nThe capital requirements for future data centers are likely \nto be immense. Moody\u2019s estimates that global data center \ncapacity\twill\tdouble\tover\tthe\tnext\tfive\tyears.\tConsidering\tthe\t\naddition of 15 MW of new capacity at a rate of $12.5 million \nper MW, the cost of this growth will amount to $188 billion, \nwhile their market value is estimated at approximately $281 \nbillion, both in present-day dollars. By comparison, the two publicly traded data center REITs have a total estimated \nvalue of $190 billion, as of early October 2024.\nFortunately, institutional investors have expressed great \ninterest in data centers. CBRE reports that 97 percent of \ninvestors plan to allocate more funding to data centers \nin 2024. REITs will continue to be a major source of \ncapital, particularly with institutional investors as capital \npartners. Data centers also work well for private investors: \nDevelopment\tis\thighly\tprofitable\tcompared\tto\tother\tforms \t\nof real estate and long leases with credit tenants support \nhigh loan to value ratios.\nIn\tsummary,\tdata\tcenters\tare\tcurrently\thighly\tprofitable\tfor \t\nboth tenants and developers/owners. Power procurement \ndifficulties\twill\tkeep\tsupply\tbelow\tdemand\tfor\tthe\tnear-\tto \t\nmid-term, ensuring that sites with power access will lease \nup quickly at high rates. Of course, if supply constraints \nwere to materially ease, new construction would spike and \nrental rates and returns would likely decline. The outcome \nis not likely anytime soon. \n\u2014RCLCO\nSenior Housing: Building New \nMuscles\nThe historical playbook for senior housing has achieved a \ngreat deal for the sector and should not be tossed aside. \nHowever, much can be gained from a fresh lens on the future. \nAs developers wait for the capital environment to free up \ngreater access to affordable capital, planning in this space \nshould be bold and innovative. Here is an opportunity to truly \nunderstand the customer needs and preferences and position \nthe industry for success in the decades to come. \nBeginning in 2023, the population growth of those age 80 and \nolder has outpaced the level of inventory growth in the sector. \nThis supply-demand tension sets up an environment ripe for \ninnovation and strategic positioning for the next chapter of \nsenior housing development. As developers, capital partners, \nand operators plan for the growing wave of baby boomers, \nthe tailwinds are strong and their near-term impact on \ndemand fundamentals in the senior housing and health care \nsectors\tis\tsignificant.\t The\tU.S.\tbaby\tboom\tpopulation\tmakes \t\nup roughly 20 percent of the country\u2019s population and is \nprojected to grow by another 4.5 million individuals between \n2024 and 2030. And baby boomers hold an estimated 52 \npercent of the country\u2019s net wealth, amounting to about $75 \ntrillion. Despite these demographic and demand-related \ntrends,\tthe\tsector\tis\texperiencing\tsignificantly\treduced \t\ndevelopment activity, largely driven by the constrained debt \ncapital environment. This period of subdued development activity is the ideal time \nto think about what successful senior housing projects can \nlook like in the years ahead. The future cannot be a carbon \ncopy of the past. Although scaling up successful existing \nmodels remains a viable option, the current environment \npresents opportunities to develop senior housing that better \naligns with consumer preferences and capitalizes on real \nestate market trends. Investors are focusing on areas that \nare ripe for innovation and have potential to bring forth \nmeaningful offerings for the sizeable baby boom cohort that \nis on the doorstep. \nPositioning for the Middle-Market Older Adult \nWhile the baby boom population as a whole controls \nsignificant\twealth,\ta\tpronounced\tmiddle-income\tgroup\thas \t\nfewer senior housing and health care options available to \nthem. By 2033, these middle-income seniors will make up a \nprojected 44 percent of all older adult U.S. households. \nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 2025 44Property Trend #3Emerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 2025 45Chapter 2: Property Type Outlook\nCompared with private-pay senior housing overall, middle-\nmarket senior housing communities generally require \na different mindset for all stakeholders involved. To \nsuccessfully execute these projects, architects, developers, \ncapital partners, and operators need to collaborate \ncreatively\tto\tensure\tthe\tmodel\tis\tfinancially\tviable\tand \t\naligns with a price point of the middle-income cohort. Some \nolder properties\u2014perhaps even distressed properties\u2014\nacquired at a lower cost basis can be repositioned as a \nmiddle-market asset. With nearly half of senior housing \nproperties now 25 years old or older, the current inventory \npresents an opportunity to revamp. \nMeanwhile, new ground-up development projects need \nto demonstrate a high degree of discipline in managing \nconstruction costs and executing operating models that \nalign with middle-market price points. These projects require \ncreative capital structures and capital partners who are \ncommitted to this segment of senior housing. Additionally, \nmiddle-market senior housing may attract newer capital \npartners to the sector. \nConsidering Additional Emerging Models\nThe diversity within the aging population requires the \nindustry to deliver on a range of housing options for older \nadults, building on its successes and pivoting as needed to \nsupport emerging models. The active adult rental market is \ngrowing and garnering interest from developers, investors, \nand operators. An additional 2.2 million adults age 65 and \nolder are expected to enter the rental market over the next \ndecade. Developers in the active adult segment are seizing \non this demographic and offering a lifestyle-focused option \nat a price point roughly 40 percent lower than an average \nindependent living rental rate, bridging the gap between \nconventional multifamily apartments and traditional \nsenior living. Some active adult developers target middle-\nmarket older adults, while others offer higher-apportioned \namenities\tand\tfinishes\tat\thigher\tprice\tpoints. \t\nNiche-communities are increasing their offerings as \nwell. These include Storyliving by Disney, Margaritaville, \nhousing for LGBTQ older adults, communities with an \nethnic or cultural focus or inspiration, and university-based \ncommunities. While fewer in number, other models\u2014\nsuch as intergenerational senior housing communities, \ninnovative memory care housing, and condo-like senior \nhousing ownership models\u2014exist as additional options for today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s seniors. Given the demographic \ndemand, all of the above will be needed to match the \ndiverse needs of the seniors of tomorrow. \nNew Growth Stories \nSome projects already underway, or in concept development, \nhave real traction within the senior housing sector. While \noffice-to-senior-housing\tconversions\thave\tnot\tgained \t\nsignificant\ttraction,\tmeaningful\tmovement\thas\tbegun\tin \t\nrepurposing underutilized or vacant retail space. These \nprojects highlight a growing trend of redeveloping retail \nspaces into mixed-used developments that include age-\nrestricted housing, addressing both the demand for \nsenior living options and the need to revitalize vacant mall \nproperties. These projects also have the potential to align \nwell with the expectations of baby boomers and provide \nintegrated access to amenities and services as part of an \noverall redevelopment plan. Each redevelopment has a \nunique history and future potential, allowing for creative and \ninnovative uses moving forward. The following projects are \neither in development or currently open: \n\u2022 Sophia at Fox Valley and Sophia at Hawthorn Mall \n(IL).  These two mall redevelopment projects will have \n166 and 216 units, respectively, of independent living, \nassisted living, and memory care. \n\u2022 Skyview Park (NY).  Redevelopment of the Irondequoit \nMall property provides affordable housing for seniors. \n\u2022 Aljoya Thornton Place (WA).  This project, with 143 \nindependent living and assisted living residences, \nis located on the site of a former mall\u2019s satellite \nparking\u00a0lot. \t\n\u2022 Folkestone at the Promenade (MN).  This conversion \nof aging retail mall into a mixed-use development \nintegrates senior housing. It offers independent \nliving, assisted living, memory care, and long-term \ncare\u00a0apartments. \t\nThese projects provide alternatives for seniors while \nmaking smart use of available land and areas ripe for \nredevelopment. \n\u2014National Investment Center for Seniors Housing & Care Retail Resilience:  \nWeathering Every Storm \n\u2022 Despite an uptick in bankruptcies, retail leasing \nremains strong buoyed by non-merchant categories. \n\u2022 Vacancy levels are at, or near, 20-year lows across \nmost U.S. markets after three consecutive years \nof resurgent demand and little new development. \nWhile rents are climbing, the post-pandemic spike \nin construction costs has meant that few new \ndevelopments have moved forward. \n\u2022 Though contraction in the drug store industry will \nclose thousands of stores over the next couple \nof years, many expect this to become a major \nredevelopment\u00a0opportunity. \t\nFew in the market foresaw the rebound in demand for \nphysical retail space that has occurred in the few years \nfollowing the shock of the 2020 pandemic year. Virtually \nnone anticipated the strength of that rebound, which has \ndriven retail vacancy rates below levels not seen in more \nthan a decade. \nRetail leasing remained robust in 2024. While the higher \ncost of capital has chilled investment activity across all \ncommercial real estate property types, open-air shopping \ncenters\t(specifically\tgrocery-anchored\tcommunity/\nneighborhood and power centers) have been the most \nactive sector. This level of activity can be partially attributed \nto strong underlying fundamentals. In addition, retail \ninvestments didn\u2019t experience the same run-up in pricing \nand cap rate compression as other property types. Thus, for \nthe last couple of years, retail real estate offered investors \nless volatility in potential returns than other core sectors. \nInflection Point or Return of the Retail Apocalypse? \nDespite that rosy scenario, in 2023, following two years \nwith almost no major retailer bankruptcies, the market \nexperienced two of the largest chain store collapses in \ndecades. As a result, nearly 40 million square feet of space \nreturned to the market.  \nThis\ttrend\tintensified\theading\tinto\t2024.\t The\tnumber \t\nof distressed chains either liquidating or seeking debtor \nprotection increased more than 50 percent in the past year. \nCoresight\tResearch,\ta\tfirm\tthat\ttracks\tchain\tstores,\treports \t\nthat\tfor\tthe\tfirst\ttime\tsince\t2020,\ttraditional\tretailers\tare \t\nclosing more stores than they are planning to open, though \nthis difference is minimal. \nThus, while retail sales have remained in positive territory \nsince\t2020,\tthe\timpacts\tof\tthe\trecent\tinflationary\twave \t\nand resultant money tightening policies have taken a toll. \nAugust retail sales were up 2.1 percent year-over-year, \nbut monthly gains increased only 0.1 percent and were \nin negative territory in four of the previous 12 months. \nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 2025 46Property Trend #4Emerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 2025 47Chapter 2: Property Type Outlook\nMeanwhile, American consumers now owe a record $1.1 \ntrillion on their credit cards, 45 percent more than they did \nin early 2021. Additionally, the average interest rate on that \ndebt now stands at 24.5 percent, compared to 16.7 percent \nin 2021. \nAll these data points would seem to suggest that retail is at \nan\tinflection\tpoint\theading\tinto\t2025.\tOr\tis\tit? \t\nToo Little Space, Not Enough Quality \nAlthough retail merchants may be closing more units than \nthey are opening in 2024, overall occupancy growth trends \nremain in strongly positive territory. According to data from \nthe CoStar Group, as of second quarter 2024, retail vacancy \nlevels in 57 of the top 65 U.S. retail markets were at 15-year \nlows. As the head of one major U.S. retail brokerage said, \n\u201cMost of the retail bankruptcies we have seen in 2024 have \nsuch active interest from expanding concepts that it has \nnot been a major concern. For the most part, landlords are \nbackfilling\tspace\tquickly\tat\ttoday\u2019s\thigher\tlease\trates.\tIf\twe \t\nare talking about spaces of less than 10,000 square feet or \nin the 20,000- to 35,000-square-foot range, there is a deep \npool of active growth tenants.\u201d \nThe lead analyst for a major REIT explained, \u201cFor the most \npart, the recent wave of closures has been a return to more \nnormalized patterns of winners and losers in the retail \nspace and [is] not indicative of either cyclical or structural \nchallenges. The only exception to this would be in the drug \nstore category.\u201d \nIn interviews with market participants, the greatest \nconcerns they expressed were the lack of available quality \nspace in the market and the cost challenges that limit \nnew development. Bankruptcies, consolidations, and \nthe impact of eCommerce on demand\u2014topics that had \npreviously dominated the concerns of past Emerging \nTrends  interviewees were noticeably absent in this round. Their views may seem to contradict the headlines, but they \npoint to some of the major trends we expect to dominate \nthe landscape in 2024 and beyond. \nNew Growth Stories \nOff-price\tapparel,\tgrocery\tstores,\tfitness\tclubs,\tand\tdiscount\t\nstore concepts all continue to actively lease second \ngeneration junior box space. Small shop leasing is now \ndominated by restaurant, service, and nontraditional players. \nThe restaurant sector remains in aggressive expansion \nmode, with fast food and new fast casual concepts leading \nthe way. While coffee, chicken, and dessert drink (boba) \nconcepts are still putting up the strongest growth numbers \nin the quick service restaurant (QSR) category, evolving \nconsumer tastes are driving an explosion of new culinary \nconcepts inspired by cuisines from across the globe. \nAccording to the Brown Book Guide to Retail and Restaurant \nTenants,  more than 2,000 QSR concepts are in active \ngrowth mode in the United States, with plans to open nearly \n11,000 units in 2024. \nThis growth trend includes casual dining concepts\u2014a \ncategory of restaurants that has largely struggled in recent \nyears. Despite recent bankruptcies from legacy chains, a \nnew\twave\tof\tcasual\tdining\tconcepts\tis\tlargely\tbackfilling \t\nvacancies left by decades-old concepts that have struggled to \nstay relevant among shifting millennial and gen-Z consumer \ntastes. As one hospitality expert said, \u201cFrom Korean BBQs to \nchef-inspired or craft-brew focused concepts, we are seeing \na changing of the guard in the casual dining space with many \nlegacy brands struggling to remain relevant.\u201d Restaurant \nopenings among casual dining concepts are now outpacing \nclosures by a rate of two to one. \nExperiential concepts and medical spas (often called \n\u201cmedispas\u201d), categories that largely didn\u2019t exist a decade \nago (at least not in their current form), are also seeing \nsome of the most aggressive expansion. Entertainment \nconcepts, ranging from arcades to miniature golf, have \nbeen\taround\tfor\tdecades.\tNow\tthe \tmarket\tis\tbenefiting \t\nfrom an unprecedented burst of new experience-focused \nconcepts in growth mode. As one broker put it, \u201cThere are \nmore than 50 pickleball concepts alone actively expanding \nin the U.S. Most of these chains are taking large blocks of \nspace\twith\tsome\tbackfilling\tvacant\tmall\tanchor\tspots.\u201d \t\nPlanned growth from experiential concepts (which include \neverything from competitive socializing to \u201ceater-tainment,\u201d \namusement chains, and interactive art installations) could \ndrive as much as 15 million square feet of occupancy \ngrowth through the end of 2025. While this story has \nbeen positive in terms of occupancy growth so far, it is \nnot without some concern. As one institutional landlord \nshared, \u201cThese concepts open to a lot of fanfare and \nconsumer interest, but the jury is out as to how long some \ncan maintain momentum and relevancy, especially if their \nlocations\tdon\u2019t\tbenefit\tfrom\tstrong\ttourism\ttrade.\u201d \t\nMeanwhile, the market is seeing a surge in quasi-medical \nusers. Since 2018, aesthetics-focused medispas (where treatments can range from traditional spa beauty care to \nBotox, cryotherapy, and other cutting-edge procedures) \nhave doubled in the United States. Nearly 10,000 are now \nin operation, and this emerging sector added an average \nof 1,500 new locations each of the past two years. As \nthe chief executive of a major REIT active with open-air \nshopping centers said, \u201cWe always had dental and optical \nusers at our centers, but high-end medispas are among the \nnew emerging categories of retail we think most exciting.\u201d \nMedispas are hardly alone in driving quasi-medical demand \nfor retail space. As the research director of one major \ninvestment\tfirm\tnoted,\t\u201cWe\thave\tseen\tboth\turgent\tcare\tand \t\nveterinary care concepts triple in demand in recent years \nas both industries have increasingly seen private equity \ninvestment for expansion.\u201d \nHeadwinds to Development \nOne of the reasons the demand pendulum has swung \nso wildly back in favor of landlords in recent years has \nbeen that retail development still simply does not pencil \nin most parts of the country. By the close of 2024, roughly \n50 million square feet of new shopping center product \nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 2025 48Emerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 2025 49Chapter 2: Property Type Outlook\nwill have been added in the United States, up slightly from \nthe 35 million square feet of space delivered in 2023. But \nkeep in mind that between 2008 and 2020, the market \naveraged 61 million square feet of new product annually \nand more than double that from 1998 through 2007. As \nthe\towner\tof\ta\tboutique\tbrokerage\tand\tdevelopment\tfirm \t\nsaid, \u201cConstruction costs are still 30 percent to 40 percent \nabove prepandemic levels. Even in the strongest population \ngrowth\tmarkets,\tit\tis\tstill\tincredibly\tdifficult\tto\tget\tprojects \t\nto pencil.\u201d \nWhen market participants were asked about the greatest \nchallenges ahead, they ranked the risk of political instability \nhighest this year (not surprising, given the contentiousness \nof the U.S. political landscape). Continued challenges in \nnew development were the second greatest concern cited. \n\u201cWith the Federal Reserve beginning a cycle of cutting \ninterest rates, we think an improved lending environment \nwill be helpful both to investment activity and in improving \naccess to construction loans,\u201d one developer said. \u201cBut we \nalso think the improvement in 2025 is likely to be modest.\u201d Drugstores: The Challenge and the Opportunity \nOne concern that was raised multiple times in our \ninterviews was the challenges faced by the drug store \nsector. These challenges include bankruptcies, store \nclosures, and the large opioid lawsuit settlements, but the \ngreatest challenge is a structural one. \u201cThe movement of \nmore health care companies and insurers to directly market \nprescriptions to their patients is a major challenge to the \ntraditional model,\u201d one analyst told us. \u201cDrug stores had \nbeen spared most e-commerce disruption, but this trend is \nnot going away.\u201d \nYet, the challenges of the drug store sector may become an \nemerging opportunity in 2025. One broker noted, \u201cThese are \nnot\tgoing\tto\tbe\teasy\tbuildings\tto\tbackfill.\t The\tmodern\tdrug \t\nstore model is between 15,000 square feet and 18,000 square \nfeet with drive-thru windows.

Metrics\u2014\nsuch as venture capital invested into biotech companies, \nNational Institutes of Health funding statistics, and \nemployment indicators\u2014are closely watched as they \nare all proxies for growth in tenant demand. One such \nindicator is the exchange-traded fund (ETF) SPDR S&P \nBiotech\tETF \t(XBI),\twhich\tfocuses\ton\tbiotech\tfirms\tand \t\na\tfew\tpharmaceutical\tfirms.\tXBI\tis\tone\tof\tthe\tlargest \t\nbiotech-focused ETFs, with more than 130 companies in its \nportfolio. It established a high in February 2021 at $165 per \nshare during the pandemic response period. It has since \ndeclined, trending between $65 and $90 per share during \n2022 and 2023. In 2024, the fund has shown signs of \ngrowth and was over $100 per share in August. \nAnother indicator of tenant demand is employment within \nthe life sciences sector. The Bureau of Labor Statistics \n(BLS) publishes industry employment trends including \nthree that represent employment within life science \nbuildings. BLS tracks the number of employees employed \nwithin medical equipment and supplies manufacturing, \nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 2025 50Property Trend #5Emerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 2025 51Chapter 2: Property Type Outlook\npharmaceutical\tand\tmedicine\tmanufacturing,\tand\tscientific \t\nresearch and development services on an annual basis. The \ntotal number of employees within these industries grew 2 \npercent from 2022 to 2023. According to BLS, the number \nof employees in these categories has grown at a fast clip \nover\tthe\tpast\tfive\tyears\tdespite\tthe\trecent\tslowdown, \t\naveraging 4 percent per year. \nU.S. Life Science Real Estate Growth and Pains\nAs a result of the growth in life sciences research, real \nestate investors and developers have targeted the sector \nover the past several years. This interest has spurred \nhigher construction levels and inventory growth, affecting \nindustry fundamentals. As of the second quarter of \n2024, the U.S. life science real estate sector comprises \n387 million square feet of existing space, up 19 percent since the middle of 2020. The pipeline, as measured by \nconstruction square feet in progress, reached a high \npoint of 71.4 million square feet in the third quarter of \n2023. It has since fallen to 61.2 million square feet in the \nsecond quarter of 2024 but is still elevated compared to \nprevious\u00a0years. \t\nThis overall accelerated construction period has had \nan impact on industry fundamentals. As construction \ncompletions picked up, occupancy rates decreased across \nthe United States. During the past two years, the industry \nresource, RevistaLab, has tracked over 44 million square \nfeet of life science completions across the country. During \nthis period, absorption (the change in occupied space) \nhas been strong, at 20 million square feet, but below the \nlevel of completions. The occupancy rate has fallen from \n95.2 percent in second quarter 2022 to 89.9 percent as of \nsecond quarter 2024. \nMuch of the industry has experienced these growing \npains. Subleasing has risen over the past two years. which \nhas affected new and existing properties. The real pains, \nhowever, have been concentrated in speculative newly built \nor under-construction properties. To illustrate, RevistaLab \nbreaks down occupancy trends by the age of the properties. \nProperties\tthat\tare\t10+\tand\t3\u201310\tyears\told\thave \tgenerally \t\nheld\tup\tbetter\tthan\tproperties\tthat\tare \t0\u20132\tyears\told.\tIn \t\nsecond\tquarter\t2022,\tproperties\t0\u20132\tyears\told\twere\t88.9 \t\npercent occupied, on average across the United States. Two \nyears\tlater\tin\tsecond\tquarter\t2024,\tproperties\t0\u20132\tyears\told \t\nwere 80.5 percent occupied, on average. \nCore Market Performance \nWithin the core markets of Boston, San Diego, and San \nFrancisco, these supply/demand trends have been more \npronounced. These markets in aggregate have seen \ntheir occupancy rate fall from 93.5 percent in second \nquarter 2022 to 85.8 percent as of second quarter 2024. \nCompletions are outpacing absorption in these markets. \nIn second quarter 2024, absorption was 1.9 million square \nfeet, compared to completions of 10 million square feet \n(trailing 12-month basis). There is still 32.4 million square \nfeet of construction in progress in these markets, so \noccupancy pressures will continue as the pipeline works \nits way down. While much of the construction pipeline will \nopen as life science and do quite well, some speculative \nconstruction\tproperties\tare\tconverting\tto\tgeneral\toffice \t\nor other uses. And some developers are evaluating their \noptions as current supply exceeds demand in these \ncore\u00a0markets. \t\nHowever, pockets of strength can be found, even within the \ncore markets. In Boston, the interior markets of Seaport, \ndowntown, and Cambridge have maintained occupancy \nabove 90 percent as of second quarter 2024. The Route \n128 and urban edge markets have seen their inventories \ngrow, leading to lower overall occupancy rates of 85.2 \npercent and 86.9 percent, respectively. San Diego, which \nhas its largest concentration of life science real estate \nin the central submarkets, including Sorrento and Torrey \nPines, has seen completions over the past year of 1.3 \nmillion square feet and near zero absorption. Its occupancy rate sits at 84.4 percent as of second quarter 2024. And \nSan Francisco has the lowest overall second quarter 2024 \noccupancy rate of the three core markets: 82.8 percent, \ndown 750 basis points from 90.3 percent one year ago. \nGrowth in Secondary and Emerging Markets\nBeyond the three core markets, other markets have also \nseen inventory growth during the past few years. The \nRaleigh-Durham market currently has 4.1 million square \nfeet of construction in progress; the DC-Baltimore market \nhas 1.8 million square feet in progress; Philadelphia has 5.3 \nmillion square feet in progress; and Houston has 1.4 million \nsquare feet in progress. Many smaller markets also boast \nhigher occupancy rates compared to the top three core \nmarkets. Memphis and Charlotte are 100 percent occupied \nas of second quarter 2024. In addition, 11 of the top 26 \nmarkets have an occupancy rate above 95 percent as of \nsecond quarter 2024. \nOverall, the life science real estate sector is a story of \ngrowth. It is a growth story in the three core markets of \nBoston, San Diego, and San Francisco; and other markets \nalso exhibit opportunities moving forward. A better supply/\ndemand balance should emerge as the construction \npipeline works through. And signs indicate that life science \ncompanies are in the preliminary stages of their next \ngrowth phase. \n\u2014Revista\nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 2025 52Emerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 202553\nChapter 2: Property Type Outlook\n \nTo increase the supply of, and access to, attainable single-\nfamily housing, experts across the industry now point to a \nrange of solutions: \n\u2022 Promote renting over owning in markets where the \nhousing costs are high. \n\u2022 Consider alternative uses to existing real estate buildings \nand developments. \n\u2022 Use technologies, such as manufactured housing, to \nprovide more homes, quicker. \n\u2022 Provide housing vouchers as needed. \n\u2022 Use value engineering to make homes more affordable.  \nNearly all housing market experts agree the U.S. housing \nmarket is undersupplied. John Burns Research and Consulting \nestimates the United States has undersupplied total \nhousing demand\u2014including single-family, multifamily, and \nmanufactured housing\u2014by 1.8 million units. Combining this \nundersupply with other housing needs (due to demographic \ndemand, second-home demand, and replacement housing) \nmeans the United States will have to construct 18 million \nhousing units over the 10-year period from 2024 to 2033 to \nbring demand and supply back into balance. The chronic \nundersupply of homes has resulted in rising prices and \nmassive pressure on affordability across the country. \nWhile the Federal Reserve\u2019s recent easing of interest rates \nshould allow mortgage rates to fall, access to housing that \nprospective buyers can afford will remain a major hurdle for many people. The industry continues to discuss and create \nsolutions to provide more access to market rate homes\u2014with \nthose solutions ranging from increased density to new laws \nand regulations. This section is based on interviews with a \nwide range of industry experts and highlights their ideas for \nsolving the issue of attainable housing in the United States. \n1. Single-family rentals:  The institutional single-family rental \nindustry\tbegan\tprimarily\tas\ta\tsolution\tto\tfill\tthe\tgap\tin \t\ndemand between homeowners and apartment renters. \nMany tenants lack the down payment or FICO score \nSingle-Family HousingEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 202554evolve, some companies are using proprietary methods \nto construct homes off site\u2014faster, more safely, and \nmore\tefficiently\tthan\tthose\twho\tbuild\ton\tsite.\tHowever, \t\none\tof\tthe\tmost\tsignificant\tobstacles\tto\tthis\ttype\tof \t\nindustry expansion is the lack of acceptance by local \nmunicipalities, where zoning regulations either prohibit \nmanufactured homes outright or encumber the process of \npermitting manufactured homes (as they are constructed \noff site). If municipalities widely accepted manufactured \nhousing, the industry could deliver more homes faster, \npositively affecting affordability. \n4. Housing vouchers:  For low-income households that \ncannot afford to rent or own, housing vouchers are \na pathway to housing. The Florida Policy Project, for \nexample, espouses the use of housing vouchers to allow \nlow-income households to decide where they want to live \n(i.e., close to work or family). The voucher is an income \nsubstitute and gives households a greater opportunity to \nchoose among rental options in their market. \n5. Density constraints:  A common theme among developer \ninterviewees was restrictive density and zoning laws \nacross municipalities. Markets like Boise, Idaho, and \nNorthwest Arkansas have experienced massive domestic \nmigration from more expensive regions of the country. \nThe\tinflux\tof\tnew\tresidents\tresulted\tin\tstrong\tdemand \tnecessary to qualify under today\u2019s underwriting standards, \nor they prefer to rent. Demand for single-family rentals \nexploded with the erosion of affordability in the United \nStates; the monthly cost of purchasing a typical single-\nfamily starter home exceeds rent in 20 of the largest \nmarkets nationwide. The gap is most pronounced in \nAustin, Texas, where the cost to purchase a single-family \nstarter home is 95 percent more than the rent for a single-\nfamily starter home (the total dollar difference is $2,085 \nper month). \n2. Adaptive reuse: \tSome\tindustry\texperts\tidentify\tspecific \t\nreal\testate\tsectors\t(senior\tliving,\toffice,\thotels)\tas\tprime \t\nopportunities to purchase distressed properties and \ntransform into affordable housing. In the senior living \nindustry, many of the large continuing care retirement \ncommunities did not recover from the COVID-19 \npandemic and are facing debt, with outsized bond \nfacilities\tcompared\twith\tcash\tflow\tgenerated.\tIn\taddition, \t\nlabor costs are higher (often more than 30 percent higher) \nthan projected. \n3. Manufactured housing:  Manufactured housing is a \nprimary topic in conversations about affordable housing, \nas\ta\tnew\tmanufactured\thome\toffers\tthe\tbenefit\tof \t\nlower labor costs and shortened cycle times. While \nthe technology for manufactured housing continues to \nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 202555\nChapter 2: Property Type Outlookand rapid price appreciation, which pushed many locals \nfarther away from their jobs and daily conveniences. The \nneed for attainably priced housing is particularly acute \nin these high in-migration markets, and many builders \nwe interviewed want to build smaller homes to achieve \nlower overall price points. However, municipalities often \nrestrict these types of homes, because of either old zoning \nguidelines that require large lots and low density or the \ninfluence\tof\tresidents\twho\tfight\tfor\tlower\tdensity,\tsimilar \t\nto what already exists. \n6. Value engineering:  Builders cite value engineering as \na method to lower home prices. Value engineering can \nrange from stripping the architectural details from the \nfacade\tof\ta\thome\tto\toffering\tluxury\tvinyl\tplank\tflooring \tinstead of tile or wood (depending on costs at the time of \nthe build). Some builders use \u201cpackage\u201d upgrades instead \nof allowing a customer to choose options in a home. \nThe predetermined packages help streamline costs for \nthe builder and bring down the price of the home for the \nbuyer. Value engineering can encounter pushback when \nthe exterior of the home or community does not meet the \n\u201cstandards\u201d of a municipality. For example, one builder \nconstructed townhouses on a highly visible thoroughfare. \nThe product was one color and simply constructed, and \nenough local residents complained that the municipality \nput a moratorium on townhouse development. Careful \nconsideration and open communication between builders \nand municipalities could mitigate this type of situation and \nallow more affordable products to be constructed. \nCase Study: Success Story, Myrtle Beach \nMyrtle Beach is a great success story, showcasing the \nresults of a municipality that is \u201copen for business\u201d and \nworking with developers and builders to grow. Myrtle \nBeach has long been a growth market, attracting buyers \nand renters from across the country to its affordable \nhomes, good beaches, golf course access, and general \nquality of life. During the pandemic, the area was one of \nthe top in-migration destinations, as many residents of \nCharlotte, Raleigh, and other Southeast markets moved \nto Myrtle Beach. Some wanted to work from home, while others were retired and simply wanted to live in the area. \nThe local government was open to development\u2014and \nall product types\u2014and the area experienced a housing \nmarket boom. Total building permits in Myrtle Beach \nincreased nearly 34 percent in 2021 to over 12,200, and \npermitting has remained elevated since then. The diversity \nof product types built over the past four years\u2014from large \nestate homes to cottage-style build-to-rent communities\u2014\ntranslates to a wide range of prices, making room for all \nincome levels to live.\nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 202556projected slowdown in deliveries in current high-supply \nmarkets points to a rebound in rent growth, which is boosting \ninvestor\tconfidence\tand\thelping\trevive\tthe\tmoribund \t\ntransactions\u00a0market.\nLooking long term, the sharp increase in housing prices as \npost pandemic demand soared has continued to spotlight \naffordability. This concern has increasingly permeated the \npublic consciousness, to the point of being an issue in the \n2024 elections. \u201cSupply will drive the discussion about housing \nfor the foreseeable future,\u201d said the head of an industry trade \ngroup. Housing policy experts know that the United States \nneeds more supply at price points affordable to low- and \nmoderate-income households. The question is whether that \ncan be achieved given the cost and political dynamics on the \nlocal, state, and federal levels. \nOngoing Strong Demand \nMultifamily property performance has been driven by robust \ndemand, and that is likely to continue. The market set \nabsorption records in 2021 as the job market rebounded and \npeople wanted more space to work from home in the suburbs \nand Sunbelt markets. While demand is no longer as hot, it is \nstill healthy. Analysts expect performance to remain strong for \nmany reasons:\n\u2022 Demographics:  The population of individuals age 20 to \n34, the prime renter age, will rise through 2030, then level \noff. The population in the 65-and-older cohort also is rising \nrapidly, and this group is increasingly choosing to rent \nmultifamily and single-family units. \u2022 The conversation about the apartment market will be \ndominated in 2025 by the topic of supply. A wave of \napartment deliveries that began several years ago\u2014\nconcentrated in the Sunbelt\u2014is winding down with a \nsupply glut on the other side. \n\u2022 Industry experts remain bullish on demand remaining \nstrong for the next few years due to strong job growth, \nfavorable demographics, immigration, the high cost of \nhomeownership, and the lack of single-family inventory.\n\u2022 A growing number of renters are cost burdened, which \nhas put a spotlight on the need for more market-rate \nand affordable supply. Affordable housing concepts will \nincreasingly be fused into market-rate developments.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Supply, Stupid\u201d\nBill Clinton famously invoked the phrase\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s the economy, \nstupid\u201d\u2014to win the presidency in 1992. The story of the \nmultifamily industry in 2025 could well be summed up \nsimilarly: \u201cIt\u2019s the supply, stupid.\u201d\nSupply growth informs every element of the multifamily \noutlook. It is the biggest element of near-term performance, \nwith rent growth negative in high-growth markets and \ngrowing in low-supply areas. In the medium term, the \nMultifamily HousingEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 202557\nChapter 2: Property Type Outlook\u2022 Weak single-family market sales:  The large gap between \nthe cost of owning and renting and the lack of for-sale \ninventory is keeping would-be homeowners in apartments. \nThe cost of owning was 40 percent higher than renting \nin early 2024, and while that number will moderate as \nmortgage rates drop, the affordability gap is likely to \nremain\tsignificant.\tHigh-income\tmillennials\tand\tgen\tXers \t\nincreasingly choose to rent rather than buy homes.\n\u2022 Work from home:  The need for more space for home \noffices\tleads\tsome\trenters\tto\tmove\tfrom\tshared \t\nhouseholds or away from their parents\u2019 homes.\n\u2022 Immigration: \tThe\tCongressional\tBudget\tOffice\testimated \t\nthat 6 million immigrants moved to America in 2022 and \n2023, a mix of legal and undocumented immigrants and \nasylum seekers.

Deliveries are on track to peak at more than \n500,000 in 2024. However, starts are plunging due to cost \nof\tconstruction\tfinancing,\tthe \tincreasing\tcost\tof\tland\tand \t\nmaterials, the shortage of labor, the slowing entitlement \nprocess in many jurisdictions, and worries about supply \nglut. These issues may lead to another bout of above-\ntrend rent growth in 2026 and beyond.Regional Rent Story\nThe\trecord-high\trent\tgrowth\tin\t2021\tand\t2022\thas\tflattened \t\nout but not evenly across the country. Rent growth in late \n2024 was negative year-over-year in rapid-supply-growth \nmetro areas such as Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, Nashville, \nOrlando, Phoenix, Raleigh, Salt Lake City, and Tampa, and \ngrowth is likely to remain weak while the wave of deliveries is \ndigested. Meanwhile, rent growth remains moderately positive \nin markets in the Northeast (Boston, New Jersey, New York) \nand Midwest (Chicago, Columbus, Indianapolis, Kansas City, \nMilwaukee) where demand has remained consistent but the \nrate of deliveries has not been as great. \nWhile rent performance varies, apartment demand remains \npositive in every region. \u201cBarring a massive Black Swan event, \nwe should see a soft landing and normalizing growth that will \nproduce good demand for rental housing,\u201d said one senior \nmultifamily strategist. In fact, absorption remains strongest \nin the areas of the Sunbelt where rent growth is weak, a sign \nto market players that growth will resume after the current \nsupply wave is digested. \u201cMy biggest concern is that we are \nnot starting enough construction and will pay the price in two \nto three years,\u201d said a senior industry researcher.\nRising Costs, Especially Insurance\nNot everything in the outlook is rosy. Property owners face rising \nexpenses that hit hard at a time when income growth is tepid. \nDriven by jumps in the cost of labor, materials, maintenance, \nand insurance, the average expense per unit rose 27.4 percent \nin the four years ending August 2024, according to Yardi Matrix. \nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 202558Insurance has been the biggest driver, rising 106 percent over \nthat period, per Matrix. Such increases make it critical for owners \nto\timprove\toperating\tefficiency,\tusing\ttechnology\tand\tdata\tto \t\nanalyze\tstaffing,\tcontrollable\texpenses,\tsafety,\tand\tutility\tcosts. \t\nTechnology also can be used to improve tenant experience by \nintegrating systems and improving communication, which will \nhelp attract and retain residents.\nEyeing the Impact of Lower Rates\nThe\tflow\tof\tmultifamily\tdeals\thas\tbeen\tstuck\tin\tneutral\tsince \t\ninterest rates shot up in mid-2022. Activity will very likely pick \nup in 2025 as interest rates come down (barring unexpected \neconomic events). The question is, how much? In general, \nindustry experts expect multifamily sales activity to increase \nmodestly in 2025, not getting back to anywhere near the peak \nyear of 2021, when $358 billion changed hands, according \nto\u00a0MSCI. \t\nAlthough the risk-free rate is dropping, it is not enough to \neliminate the persistent bid-ask gap. Acquisition yields for \nstable properties remain in the 5 percent range, still below \nmortgage rates, which are in the 5.5 percent range. Investors \nare willing to accept returns that amount to negative leverage \nbecause they believe rent growth will boost returns starting in 2025 or 2026. The multifamily segment does have an \nadvantage over some other property segments: a large \namount of dry powder and optimistic investors.\nLower\tmortgage\trates\twill\talso\tspur\trefinancing\tof\tunderwater \t\nloans, but whether and how long the market can hold off \ndistress remains another question. Some $470 million of \nmultifamily loans are set to mature in late 2024 and 2025, \nabout 20 percent of the market\u2019s balance, according to the \nCRE Finance Council and Trepp. Many of those loans were \noriginally scheduled to mature in 2023 and 2024 but were \nextended because of debt-service constraints in a higher-\nrate environment. Industry analysts expect an increase in \ndelinquencies in 2025, but few expect a 2008-level crash. \n\u201cThere absolutely will be some distressed sales. But overall, \nbecause of factors including demographics, job growth, and \nthe lack of single-family housing, the multifamily sector is in \ndecent shape,\u201d said a senior researcher.\nMost experts expect distress to occur in pockets, such as \nvalue-add\tproperties\tbought\tin\t2020\u20132021\twith\thigh\tleverage\t\nand short-term debt, particularly collateralized loan obligations. \nAnother area of potential trouble is new construction projects \nin the Sunbelt that are slow to lease up because of competition \nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 202559\nChapter 2: Property Type Outlookwith other new projects. According to a senior strategist, \n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of distress in busted value-add class C stuff, [with] \nmuch more stability in class A and B+ assets.\u201d The strategist \nnoted that institutions don\u2019t want that type of product, and \nsyndicators might not have capital to buy. \u201cThe big question for \n[2025] is who buys the class C syndicators out?\u201d \nA senior mortgage executive noted that major real estate \ndownturns involve periods when a lack of liquidity exacerbates \nproblematic fundamentals\u2014something that does not describe \nmultifamily today. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a bloodbath, it\u2019s because of \nlimited liquidity. [That\u2019s] not the case in multifamily.\u201d \nGrowing Attention on Affordability\nRising housing costs have propelled the need for affordable \nhousing into the public consciousness, creating a consensus \nthat the housing shortage and lack of affordability requires an \nall-hands-on-deck approach. Industry experts are calling for a \nrange of solutions, such as building new units, rehabilitating \nolder stock, incentivizing and subsidizing units, removing \nzoning barriers, streamlining the entitlement process, and more. \n\u201cWe will not be able to solve the housing shortage unless we \nbuild more, and builders are not willing to build in some areas because\tit\tis\ttoo\tdifficult,\u201d\tsaid\tthe \thead\tof\tresearch\tat\ta\tlarge \t\nmultifamily\tbrokerage\tfirm.\t\u201cIt\tshouldn\u2019t\ttake\ta\tbureaucratic \t\nordeal to get projects approved,\u201d noted a multifamily developer. \nJurisdiction over housing rests mainly on the local level, \nbut efforts to resolve the affordability problem need to \nbe coordinated among a mix of federal, state, and local \njurisdictions. Proposed policy solutions include expanding \ntax credit programs such as the Low-Income Housing Tax \nCredit program, directly subsidizing affordable development, \ncreating incentives to preserve existing housing, expanding \ndirect subsidies to renters in Section 8 and housing choice \nvouchers, providing federal funding for municipalities that \nincrease density, relaxing zoning codes, and streamlining the \nentitlement process that discourages developers. \nBuilding more market-rate product is essential to create more \nlower-cost\tunits\tthrough\tfiltering\ti.e.,\tthe\tprocess\tthrough \t\nwhich older housing stock becomes more affordable without \nsubsidies as newer, more modern housing stock is introduced \ninto the market. At the same time, more movement from \nmarket-rate into the affordable segment would be helpful. \u201cWe \nneed\tto\tfind\texperienced\t[market-rate]\tdevelopers\tthat\thave \t\nnever done a tax credit deal but recognize the need for it,\u201d said \na senior lending executive who does tax credit deals. \u201cWhen \ndevelopment becomes more in tune with housing needs, more \ndevelopers will want to use the tax credit program.\u201d\nWhile this outlook was written before the November 2024 \nelection, the results will have a major impact on the housing \npicture. Vice President Kamala Harris has proposed plans \nthat would stimulate up to 3 million housing units but has \nalso proposed a form of rent control that has always proven \nto suppress supply. Former President Donald Trump\u2019s plans \nare less concrete, but he has promised to reduce regulatory \nbarriers to development.\nPolicymakers\tin\tmarkets\twith\tdifficult\tregulatory\tenvironments \t\nare increasingly recognizing the role housing plays in \neconomic development. For example, a study by the Regional \nPlan\tAssociation,\ta\tNew\tYork\u2013based\tthink\ttank\tthat\tfocuses \t\non the area\u2019s economic development, found that the New York \nCity tri-state area could miss out on $1 trillion of economic \nactivity\tover\tthe\tnext\tdecade\tbecause\tit\tlacks\tsufficient \t\nhousing. Clearly, cities have to not just react to current needs \nbut also recognize that future growth depends on the quality \nand affordability of housing stock. As an apartment strategist \nnoted, \u201c2025 is a unique moment. Cities that are willing to take \na step now and work with developers on affordable housing \nwill be successful.\u201d\nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 202560The hotel sector continues to exhibit steady growth, marked by \nyear-over-year gains in average daily room rates and revenue per \navailable room (RevPAR). Despite this growth, hotel supply has \nremained stagnant\u2014a trend that is expected to potentially reverse \nas\tthe\texpanding\thotel\tconstruction\tpipeline\tcomes\tto\u00a0fruition. \t\nAmid the uncertain economic environment and decelerating \nconsumer spending, the hotel sector is experiencing a \nnotable\tbifurcation,\twith\thigher-priced\thotels\tsignificantly \t\noutperforming lower-priced hotels.

These niche sectors are \nexpected to continue to garner investor interest. However, \ntheir expansion as an asset class is likely to be constrained by \nthe lack of liquidity and noninstitutional nature (so far), even \nthough lodging brands are strongly exploring adopting the \nconcepts into their brand ecosystems. \nBifurcation in Hotel Performance \nThe bifurcation in hotel performance, driven by the overall \neconomic\tenvironment,\thas\tled\tluxury\thotels\tto\tsignificantly \t\noutperform economy hotels over the past year. Consumers with \nhigher\tincomes\thave\tbenefited\tfrom\tsubstantial\twealth\tcreation, \t\ngiving them more discretionary spending power and greater \nwillingness to travel. Conversely, lower income demographic \ngroups\tfeel\tmore\tstrongly\tthe\tinflationary\tpressures\tthat\thave\tled \t\nto higher costs for essential items such as housing and food. A \nJuly\t2024\tsurvey\tof\tAmericans,\tconducted\tby\tRedfield\t&\tWilton \t\nStrategies on behalf of Newsweek , found that 44 percent of \nrespondents will not be traveling in the next three months, with \nabout half of them saying they would have gone on a vacation \nif the cost of living was cheaper. This increased economic \npressure has made travelers more price-conscious, leading them \nto explore more cost-effective accommodation options such \nas short-term rentals or camping, which often present a more \naffordable alternative to traditional hotels. The operating performance of hotels makes the bifurcation \nclear. According to STR, as of August 2024, the luxury hotel \nsegment experienced 12-month RevPAR growth of 1.8 \npercent, while the economy hotel segment experienced a \n12-month RevPAR decline of 3.6 percent. For the trailing 12 \nmonths ending August 2024, the average daily room rate for \nluxury hotels in 2024 was up 30.3 percent compared to 2019, \nwhile the average daily room rate for economy hotels was up \n14.3\u00a0percent. \t\nGiven the deceleration in consumer spending and ongoing \neconomic uncertainty, the current bifurcation in hotel \nperformance is expected to persist in the near term. According \nto PwC Hospitality Directions, as of May 2024, luxury segment \nRevPAR is expected to increase by 1.1 percent in 2025 while \nthe economy segment RevPAR is expected to remain largely \nunchanged in 2025. However, the worst of this bifurcation in \nhotel performance may be behind us with the performance gap \nexpected to tighten in 2025. \nHospitality: The Rise of Alternative \nConcepts, AI, and Sustainability Emerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 202561\nChapter 2: Property Type OutlookEvolving Travel Patterns \nLodging sector demand in the United States in the next 12 \nmonths is expected to be driven by the return of inbound \ninternational travelers (particularly Chinese) and increased \ndomestic travel by Americans. International travel to the \nUnited States is expected to be close to prepandemic levels \nby the end of 2024, with the National Travel and Tourism \nOffice\tforecasting\tthat\ttotal\tinternational\tarrivals\tto\tthe\tUnited \t\nStates will reach 77.7 million in 2024, compared with 79.4 \nmillion in 2019. This growth trend is expected to continue, \nas international arrivals in 2025 are forecast to surge to 85.2 \nmillion,\tfinally\tsurpassing\t2019\tlevels.\t The\tincrease\tis\tlargely\ta \t\nresult of continuing efforts to boost international visitation to \nthe United States by lowering visitor visa wait times. \nDespite the growth in overall international tourism, Chinese \ntourism\tto\tthe\tUnited\tStates\tremains\tsignificantly\tbelow \t\nprepandemic levels. But some positive signs indicate the \nreturn to these levels will be quicker than initially expected. \nAccording\tto\tthe\tNational\t Travel\tand\t Tourism\tOffice,\t1.1\tmillion \t\nChinese tourists visited the United States in 2023. This number \nrepresents a substantial 192 percent increase compared with \n2022 but is only 38 percent of 2019 levels. Growth is expected \nto continue, with Chinese tourism to the United States now \nforecast to fully recover by 2026\u2014one year sooner than the \nprojection in Emerging Trends  2024. \nWhile international inbound travel to the United States is still \nlagging prepandemic levels, international outbound demand \nhas already surpassed those levels. COVID-19 and the ensuing \ntravel restrictions created a bottleneck of international trips \namong Americans. The consensus is that the majority of these outbound trips were completed in 2023 and 2024, as global \ntravel restrictions eased. \nThe shift toward international travel led to a deceleration in \ndomestic travel, which is projected to decline by 5.1 percent in \n2024,\tmarking\tthe\tfirst\tannual\tdecrease\tsince\t2020.\tDespite \t\nthis recent slowdown, travelers are expected to pivot back to \ndomestic travel in 2025. Having completed their backlogged \ninternational trips over the past two years, many Americans \nare less inclined to travel abroad again in 2025. Coupled \nwith a potential deceleration in consumer spending amid \neconomic uncertainty, that sentiment is fostering a conducive \nenvironment for domestic travel in the United States. The \ncombination of a resurgence in inbound international \ntourism and the anticipated return to domestic travel among \nAmericans positions the U.S. lodging sector for a strong \nresurgence in 2025. \nAlternative Hospitality Concepts \nDriven by secular demographic and consumer trends, the \nemergence of niche and alternative subsectors within \ntraditional real estate asset classes has become a prevailing \ntrend, and the hotel asset class is no exception. Investors \ncontinue to explore the expansion of the investable asset \nbase and corners of asset classes that have the potential \nfor institutionalization. Camping-style accommodations and \nwellness-focused offerings have emerged as prominent trends \nwithin the hospitality sector. \nRecognizing the evolving consumer preference for unique travel \nexperiences, some hotel companies are strategically aligning \nwith niche hospitality concepts. In early 2024, a leading hotel \ncompany announced a strategic partnership with a company \nspecializing in upscale \u201cglamping\u201d accommodations such as \nAirstreams, cabins, and luxury tents. Separately, in July 2024, \nanother major hospitality company entered into a strategic \npartnership with another company that offers upscale glamping \nnear U.S. national parks. In the postpandemic environment, a \ngrowing preference for outdoor vacations has emerged, and \ncamping-style accommodations appear to be an enduring trend. \nAccording to the 2024 KOA Camping & Outdoor Hospitality \nReport,  approximately 54 million U.S. households engaged in \ncamping activities in 2023, an 11 percent increase compared \nwith 2019. This trend is likely to continue given the anticipated \nincrease in domestic travel in 2025. \nAnother alternative is wellness-related travel, especially at \nhigher-end hotels. One example is a rise in luxury wellness \nretreats. These retreats often provide personalized experiences \ndesigned to help guests connect with nature and undergo a \nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 202562transformative stay. For instance, one wellness resort owned \nby\ta\tmajor\thotel\tcompany\tallows\tguests\tto\tfill\ttheir\tdaily \t\nschedules with a variety of activities that cater to physical, \nmental, and spiritual well-being. Additionally, guests have \naccess to an extensive spa for relaxation during their free time, \nand all meals are provided on site, ensuring guests never need \nto leave the premises. \nThe growing popularity of wellness retreats coincides \nwith modern lifestyles that leave many individuals feeling \ndisconnected from nature and spending too much time in \nfront of screens. Wellness retreats offer one way to counteract \nthese trends. Although retreats typically come at a much \nhigher price point than traditional hotel stays, they have been \nable to sustain growth due to their comprehensive offerings, \nabove and beyond the typical leisure vacation. Travelers \nare now opting to stay at hotels for the distinctive wellness \nexperiences and amenities offered by the hotels themselves, \nrather than primarily for the attractions of the surrounding \narea.\tWhether\tin\ttraditional\thotels\tor\twellness-specific\tretreats, \t\nthe emerging trend of wellness is poised to continue. \nExpanding Regulatory Oversight \nThe trend that has the most potential to affect the hospitality \nindustry in the next 12 months may be the expanding state and local regulatory environment across various issues, including \nshort-term rentals, labor unions, and other state and local \ngovernment interventions. New York City Local Law 18, which \nwent into effect in September 2023, requires short-term rentals \nto\tbe\tregistered\tthrough\tthe\tOffice\tof\tSpecial\tEnforcement\tand \t\nsignificantly\tdecreased\tthe\tsupply\tof\tshort-term\trentals\tin\tthe \t\ncity. Major markets across the country have taken notice and \nattempted to enact similar laws to quell the rise of short-term \nrentals. For example, in April 2024, the Los Angeles board of \nsupervisors unanimously approved an ordinance that will restrict \nthe short-term rental market in unincorporated Los Angeles \nCounty. The ordinance requires hosts to pay an annual fee, limits \nthe length of guest stays, and restricts hosts from listing second \nhomes and guest homes as short-term rentals. \nElsewhere across the country, many efforts to restrict short-\nterm\trentals\thave \thad\tdifficulty\tgetting\tthrough\tthe\tstate \t\nlegislative system. For instance, Florida\u2019s Senate Bill 280, \nwhich aimed to grant the state greater regulatory control over \nshort-term rentals, was passed in early 2024 but subsequently \nvetoed by the governor. Despite such ongoing challenges, the \nmomentum toward increased regulation in the short-term \nrental market is expected to persist. The strongest demand for \nthese restrictions is coming from suburban residents who cite \ndisturbances associated with short-term rentals in their area. \nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 202563\nChapter 2: Property Type OutlookIt is important to recognize that the tightening state and local \nregulatory environment appears to be bipartisan, with neither \nmajor\tpolitical\tparty\tadopting\ta\tdefinitive\tstance.\tWhile\tthe \t\nfeasibility of the regulations being enacted remains uncertain \nand their implementation may be protracted, this regulatory \ntrend warrants close attention in the short to medium term due \nto\tits\tpotentially\tsignificant\teffect\ton\thotels\tacross\tmarkets. \t\nIncreasing Hotel Pipeline to Reverse Stagnant Supply Growth \nHotel supply has remained largely stagnant in recent years, \nprimarily due to challenges arising from the COVID-19 \npandemic, such as elevated construction costs, uncertainty \nsurrounding travel demand, and higher interest rates. \nAccording to STR, the U.S. hotel industry experienced supply \ngrowth below the long-term average of ~2 percent for two \nyears in a row: 1.7 percent in 2022 and 0.3 percent in 2023. \nSupply growth is expected to remain muted, with projections \nof 0.4 percent and 0.7 percent for 2024 and 2025, respectively, \naccording to PwC Hospitality Directions as of May 2024. \nThe restrictive construction environment in recent years \nhas led to a backlog of stalled hotel construction projects. \nHowever,\tthe\tpipeline\thas\texhibited\tsignificant\tmomentum \t\nrecently as developers seek to restart hotel construction in \nthe near term as the economic environment becomes more favorable for construction. According to STR, as of July \n2024,\tthe\tnumber\tof\thotel\trooms\tin\tfinal\tplanning\tincreased \t\nby 9.1 percent year-over-year to 271,000 rooms; the number \nof hotel rooms in the planning stage surged by a staggering \n39.3 percent year-over-year to 333,000 rooms. This trend is \nexpected to substantially boost U.S. hotel supply beginning \nin\u00a02026,\tfollowing\tfour\tyears\tof\tlimited\tsupply\tgrowth \t \n(2022\u20132025). \t\nAccording to Lodging Econometrics, the leading markets in the \nhotel construction pipeline are Dallas and Atlanta, with 189 and \n159 projects in the pipeline, respectively, as of second quarter \n2024. It\u2019s important to note that the speed at which these \nprojects transition from planning to construction is heavily \naffected by the broader U.S. lending environment. Anticipated \nrate cuts by the Federal Reserve in the short term are likely to \nease the lending environment in 2025 and beyond, potentially \naccelerating the progression of these projects. While the exact \ntiming will depend on macroeconomic factors, hotel supply will \ninevitably\texperience\ta\tsignificant\tboost\tin\tthe \tnext\tthree\tto \t\nfour years as the bottleneck of delayed construction projects \ncomes to fruition. \nArtificial Intelligence and Sustainability \n\tWhile\tintegration\tof\tartificial\tintelligence\t(AI)\twithin\tthe \t\nhospitality industry is only beginning to solidify, an element \nof AI can be found in virtually every major hotel across the \ncountry. Examples include mobile check-in systems and \nchatbots designed to assist guests with various needs. \nNevertheless, hospitality companies are consistently aiming to \nexpand\tthe\tuse\tof\tAI\tto\tboost\toperational\tefficiency,\toptimize \t\nrevenue management, and offer more tailored experiences for \nguests. Looking to 2025 and beyond, AI is poised to become \nthe new norm in the industry. Companies that remain skeptical \nrisk falling behind, while those that effectively leverage AI will \nposition themselves for success. \nSustainability is also a growing trend in the U.S. hospitality \nindustry, driven mainly by younger travelers. According to a \nstudy conducted by Washington State University\u2019s Carson \nCollege of Business, 54 percent of millennial travelers and \n57 percent of gen-Z travelers consider sustainability a top \npriority when traveling. However, only 13 percent of gen-Zers \nand\tmillennials\treported\tstaying\tat\tgreen-certified\tlodgings. \t\nThis discrepancy is indicative of a broader trend: While many \ntravelers are supportive of sustainable practices, price remains \nthe predominant factor in their lodging choices. Given the high \ninitial costs often associated with implementing sustainable \npractices, hotels have not widely adopted them.\nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 202564 \n\u2022 Five\tyears\tinto\tthe\thybrid\twork\tera,\tthe\toffice\tmarket \t\nremains highly fragile.

This deviation from historic trends is noteworthy \nconsidering that student housing rent growth never eclipsed \nits conventional market-rate counterpart during the 2010s \ncycle. But the reason student housing rent growth has recently \noutperformed that of conventional market-rate is simple: it all \ncomes down to supply and demand. \nFrom\ta\tdemand\tperspective,\tstudent\thousing\thas\tbenefited \t\nfrom\ta\tsteady\tflow\tof\tstudents\tentering\tits\tdemand\tpool. \t\nThough demographic trends have put downward pressure on \nbroader enrollment growth, the post-2020 period saw a short-\nterm spike in enrollment. And a dearth of alternative living \narrangements (i.e., the shadow market of \u201cstudent-competitive \nhousing,\u201d typically conventional apartments near a campus) \npost-2020 channeled even more demand into the purpose-built \nstudent sector. \nSupply, however, is the key force behind the sector\u2019s recent \nrenaissance. The 2020s cycle has seen a 35 percent reduction \nin annual deliveries relative to the 2010s cycle. This reduction \nis most evident when comparing new deliveries as a share of \nexisting stock. For the United States overall, just 3 percent of \nall existing student housing supply was delivered in fall 2024, \ndown from roughly 8 percent per year in the 2010s cycle. At a \nlocal level, this decrease has allowed demand to catch up to \nsupply at several oversaturated campuses. \nIn turn, the equilibrium between supply and demand for \nstudent housing properties has led to the strongest years of \nrevenue growth on record in the industry. And investors have \ntaken notice. Though the past few years may not qualify as a recession \nby typical economic measures, one can argue that the \nconventional market-rate housing sector is\u2014at minimum\u2014\nmired in a period of softness not seen since the Great \nRecession. (The turmoil of the Great Recession was notably \nmore ubiquitous; today\u2019s period of softness is generally more \nlocalized.) But student housing\u2019s relative outperformance, \ncontrasted with a soft multifamily market, has helped provide \na baseline of comparison that is attracting more institutional \ninvestment interest. \nConsidered a largely nascent sector throughout the \n2010s cycle, student housing in the 2020s cycle provides \na comparison point that effectively proves its \u201crecession \nresistant\u201d moniker. And therein lies the key driver behind \nStudent Housing Graduates to \nSector Maturity Emerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 202569\nChapter 2: Property Type Outlookthe newfound interest in student housing: the sector \nappears to have graduated to a new stage of its life cycle\u2014\nsector\u00a0maturity. \t\nYet, sector maturity brings with it a new set of considerations. \nA near-universal truth in economics is that lower risk \ninvestments are accompanied with lower reward. The student \nhousing\tsector\tfits\tthat\tprofile. \t\nWhile student housing revenue growth has exceeded that \nof the conventional sector spanning from late 2022 through \n2024\u2019s 3rd quarter, the industry\u2019s peak years (roughly 8 percent \nrevenue growth) saw just half as pronounced of a peak \nthan the conventional market-rate sector (16 percent). Still, \nannualized rent change in student housing has never fallen \ninto a prolonged period of revenue loss\u2014a trend that largely \ncounters other real estate sectors. \nAnother\tdefining\tcharacteristic\tof\tsector\tmaturity\tis\texiting \t\nthe so-called shakeout phase. The impact of a post-shakeout period can be summarized as the period in which \nconsolidation\tbegins\tto\taccelerate.\tStudent\thousing\tfits\tthis \t\nprofile,\twith\tmost\toff-campus\tbeds\tbelonging\tto\tthe\tindustry\u2019s \t\ntop 25 ownership groups. \nYet another signal of sector maturity is the bifurcation of \ncampus-level demand trends. Overall U.S. enrollment is \ncontracting. This has been true since 2015, but enrollment \ncontraction has accelerated more recently. Further analysis, \nhowever, yields a more nuanced story. That is, there is a \ngrowing disparity between campuses that are experiencing \nenrollment decline versus those that have managed to stave \noff enrollment loss. Select campuses have even been able to \nsecure strong enrollment growth. \nThe bifurcation of campus-level enrollment growth largely \ndistills\tdown\tto\tstronger\tgrowth\tamong\tstate\tflagship \t\ninstitutions with brand name recognition. Student housing \nprofessionals tend to refer to these campuses as \u201cTier 1\u201d \ninstitutions. This group of schools furthers the consolidation of \ninvestment\tthat\ttypically\tmarks\ta\tmaturing\u00a0sector. \t\nConversely, smaller, less recognizable schools\u2014especially \nthose in states with overall declining populations\u2014are \nstruggling to maintain a solid enrollment base. While \nopportunity\tmay\texist\ton\ta\tsite-and-strategy-specific\tbasis\tat \t\nthese campuses, they are generally not the campuses where \ninvestment\tdollars\tare \tflowing. \t\nA\tfinal\tconsideration\tfor\tthe \tmaturation\tof\tthe\tstudent\thousing \t\nsector is the broader contraction of the U.S. college age \npopulation. At its core, student housing is an age-restricted \nhousing sector, and a contraction of overall headcount in the \n18-to-24-year-old population base will remain a headwind for \nthe foreseeable future. \nUltimately then, the student housing sector should be viewed \nas reaching its maturity cycle. With that maturation come \nsome\tbenefits,\tsuch\tas\tstability\tand\tlower\trisk,\tas\tthe\tlessons \t\nof a less-mature industry have played out. This appears \nto coincide with the growing interest among institutional \ninvestors. But counterbalancing factors such as declining \nenrollment and campus-level housing saturation (which \ndiminish the upside of development prospects) should be \ntaken into consideration as well. \n\u2014RealPage Inc.\nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 202570\nSelf-storage properties gaining prominence \nOver the past decade, the self-storage sector has grown not \nonly in size but also in investment appeal and operational \ncomplexity. Since 2014, the amount of physical self-storage \nspace in the country has expanded by 40 percent, while \nthe number of yearly investment transactions has jumped \n200 percent. In both cases, the added activity has been \nmost apparent in the nation\u2019s larger markets; these markets \nhave generally been the focus of institutional investors and \nmajor\u00a0developers. \t\nThe sector\u2019s still-large share of private investors, meanwhile, \ncontinues to be substantial in smaller metro markets and rural \nareas. Evolving demographic trends in these settings may \nbegin to bring more attention to local self-storage properties in \nthe future. \nPopulation growth picking up in small cities and towns \nAcross the country, most markets observed slower population \ngrowth from 2019 to 2024 than from 2014 to 2019. Of the \nmetro areas where population growth did accelerate, most \nwere tertiary cities in the Sun Belt or Rocky Mountain regions. \nThese zones have long been popular migration destinations, \nbut given rising living costs, relocating households are shifting \ntheir focus toward smaller settings in these areas. This \ndynamic\tis\tfavorable\tboth\tfor\tretired\thouseholds\ton\tfixed \t\nincomes and for professionals who can leverage remote work. \nIf this trend continues, it has implications for self-storage \nspace needs. \nInvestment activity reflecting shift in demographics \nWhile self-storage construction activity has been above \naverage for much of the past decade, more than half of the \nnew space has been concentrated in just 25 of the nation\u2019s \nmarkets. The combination of less development and stronger \ndemographics in smaller cities and towns bodes well for \nexisting local self-storage properties, commonly held by private \ninvestors. Amid this favorable outlook, long-time holders may \nseek to capitalize on appreciation in the sector, thus opening \nup avenues for other private buyers or organizations who want to widen their acquisition criteria.

Despite an overall softening of the labor \nmarket, health care continues to be one of the strongest \nsectors tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Health care \nemployment growth annually has remained above 4 percent \nthroughout 2024, while total nonfarm employment slowed to \n1.6 percent as of July 2024. \nDemand for health care services continues to grow as the \npopulation ages, new discoveries and medical advances \nincrease the number of medical issues that can be addressed, \nand the focal shift from reactive medical care to preventative \ncare and wellness continues. The real estate that supports \nthe health care system is largely made up of hospitals for \ninpatient\tcare\tand\tmedical\toffice\tbuildings\tfor\toutpatient\tcare. \t\nThe United States has roughly 7,250 hospitals, making up 1.8 \nbillion\tsquare\tfeet,\tand\t41,355\tmedical\toffice\tbuildings\t(MOBs), \t\nrepresenting 1.6 billion square feet. MOBs can include any \nnumber of tenant types and services, including urgent care and \nemergency services, dialysis, ambulatory surgery, and imaging \nas\twell\tas\tstandard\tphysician\toffices. \t\nMOB space has continued to see an increase in demand. \nWith advancements in health care technology, many services \ncan now be performed in an outpatient rather than inpatient \nsetting, freeing up space in the hospital for more advanced \nand complicated cases. In recent years, many of these MOB \nlocations have moved off hospital campuses and out in the \ncommunity to make them accessible to patients. This shift has \nhelped providers and hospital systems build market share and \nmore effectively serve a wide range of patients and cases. \nSupply Pressure from Low Construction Levels \nHistorically,\tmedical\toffice\tconstruction\tlevels\thave\tremained \t\nmodest as projects are typically driven by the health care \nsystems or provider. Although many projects are developed \nby third parties\u2014either fee-for-service or owned\u2014speculative \ndevelopment is minimal. Most projects don\u2019t break ground \nuntil they are largely pre-leased. This system has prevented \nsupply runups during expansion cycles and kept the pipeline \nmoving at slower times. In the current environment, however, \nMOB construction volumes have slowed considerably.

In \nthe largest 100 metro areas, absorption of MOB space has \noutpaced deliveries every quarter of the past three years. \nDuring that period, 33 million square feet were completed, and \n45 million square feet were absorbed. This demand pushed \naverage occupancy up 160 basis points from 91.4 percent to \n93 percent. Many metro areas are now at or below 5 percent \nvacancy,\twhich\tcreates\tsignificant\tsupply\tpressure.\tHealth \t\ncare tenants typically have longer lease terms of 10 years,15 \nyears, or more and are reticent to move too often and leave \ntheir patient base. As of late, providers have had to become even\tmore\tefficient\twith\ttheir\tspace\tsince\tthey\thave\tso\tfew \t\nopportunities to take on more square footage. \nUnlike more cyclical asset classes, which are prone to a \nrecession phase with lower occupancy and stagnant rent \ngrowth, MOBs tend to stay steady. Rent growth has typically \nremained around 2 percent annually until recently. This \ndynamic\thas\tbegun\tto\tshift\twith\tthe\tcongruence\tof\tinflation, \t\nhigh demand, and supply pressure dynamics. Prepandemic, \nthe average triple net lease (NNN) rent for MOBs in the top \n100 metropolitan areas stood at $21.86 per square foot. As \nof the second quarter of 2024, average NNN rent had climbed \nto $24.57 per square foot, a cumulative increase of more than \n12 percent. Overall rent growth has begun to slow in the most \nrecent quarter, but top-tier rents continue to climb. The 90th \npercentile rent, which generally represents top tier and new \nconstruction properties, has reached $38.83 per square foot, \nup 3.4 percent from a year ago. \nMetro Level Opportunities and Risk \nDemand dynamics can be vastly different market to market \ndepending on the hospital systems and provider groups in the \narea, supply fundamentals and population shifts. Not every \nmarket saw occupancy gains over the past year: in some \nareas occupancy declined. Some markets like Austin, Las \nVegas and Denver had previously seen high growth in demand \nthat has leveled off in the past few quarters. Stronger growth \nmarkets over the last year have tended to be east of the \nMississippi and centrally located like Little Rock, Chattanooga, \nand\u00a0Birmingham.\nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 202574\nMOB Sales Activity Still Slow, but Pricing Begins to Stabilize \nMOB sales volume peaked in the third quarter of 2022 when \nthe annual run rate was over $30 billion. Like other commercial \nreal estate sectors, the interest rate hikes that began during \nthat time slowed investment volume substantially and that \ntrend has continued into the second quarter of 2024. When \nrate cuts begin and buyers and sellers can glean more clarity \non pricing moving forward, activity is likely to pick up. \nAfter a consistent rise in cap rates throughout late 2022 and \n2023\tto\tapproximately\t7.5%\tin\tthe\tfirst\tquarter\tof\t2024,\tsome \t\ncompression may be beginning to occur.

Fast casual chains, \nfor example, have installed robotic makelines in the hope of \nboosting sales and turned to automated picking systems, \nautonomous vehicles, and aerial drones to transform delivery \nto keep pace with increasingly impatient Americans. \nThe rewards are potentially vast. Retail has fully rebounded  \nfrom its pandemic nadir, restaurants are having their best year \never  with a projected $1.1 trillion in 2024 sales, and industrial \nis continuing to surge. Upstarts and incumbents alike are \nbetting that putting the three (retail, restaurants, and industrial) \ntogether will yield a revolution in commercial real estate. \n From Omnichannel to \u201cMetachannel\u201d \nThe\tevolution\tof\tpandemic-era\tdelivery\tapps\texemplifies \t\nthis trend. These apps started as platforms for dispatching \nmeals or groceries from mom-and-pop stores.

Not content \nto remain just apps, they\u2019ve also branched into both hardware \nand software, including smart shopping carts, point-of-sale \nadvertising, and dark store management\u2014all on behalf of retail \npartners. They now comprise a delivery ecosystem with asset-\nlight platforms at one end and retail giants at the other. Drones, Meals, and Automobiles:  \nAutomation at the Intersection of Retail and Industrial \nTogether, they are fusing traditional retail and industrial into \nwhat might be called a \u201cmetachannel\u201d model, combining \nstorefronts\tand\twarehouses\u202f(sometimes\tunder\tone\troof). \t\nMeal\tand\tgrocery\tdelivery\twas\tthe\tfirst\tto\tstart.\tIn\tpractice, \t\nthis\tmeans\tmicro-fulfillment\tcenters\t(MFCs),\twhich\ttypically \t\nrange\tin\tsize\tfrom\t10,000\u201350,000\tsquare\tfeet,\tincreasingly \t\nuse automation to accelerate orders and reduce labor costs. \nOne company synonymous with e-commerce is opening fully \nautomated MFCs in conjunction with its retail arm, which has \nresumed expansion into suburban areas. \nUntil recently, the upfront expense of building automated \nMFCs has been prohibitive for all but the busiest operators \nwith the deepest pockets. But a new wave of startups aims to \nreduce the size and cost of MFCs  by as much as 80 percent. \nReductions on that scale would not only bring them within \nreach of the long tail of retailers but potentially transform \nany given storage room into a hub for local deliveries, further \nblurring the line between retail and industrial. \nWhere the Robot Meets the Road \nBut why stop there? Given that the costs of delivery\u2014due \nto\twages\tand\tregulations\u2014can\trapidly\terode\tprofit\tmargins, \t\nrobots are increasingly being dispatched to cover the last \nmile. Just as with autonomous vehicles, years of testing and \npiloting\tis\tfinally\tyielding\tresults\tat\tscale.\tFor\texample,\tone \t\nof the leading urban robotics startups has completed more \nthan 7 million fully autonomous trips on university campuses \nwith its mini-fridge-size delivery bots. Its competitors include \nride-hailing platforms that deploy both robots and delivery-\ndedicated\tvehicles\tcapable \tof\toperating\tin\tmixed\ttraffic\ton \t\nsuburban streets. \nThese companies have reason to embrace autonomy. Recent \nresearch by the University of Michigan  indicates human drivers \nprefer delivering food rather than people, placing pressure on \nride-hailing businesses. This would explain why ride-hailing \nbusinesses and robotaxi operators are forging alliances to \nbring the latter onto the former\u2019s platform. After more than \na decade of hype and disappointment, automated vehicles \nmay at last be on the cusp of achieving critical mass in both \ntransportation and delivery. Emerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 202576The Final Frontier \nAs America\u2019s exurbs race toward the horizon, not even \nautomated vehicles may be enough to deliver the convenience \nresidents crave at a cost they are willing to pay. As one \nsolution to that sprawl, a number of last-mile delivery startups \nare taking to the air with drones. Potentially, 82 million \nsuburban backyards  can double as landing pads. Seeing the \npotential, retailers are running pilots from some of their stores. \nFor now, the economics are daunting, with deliveries costing \noperators as much as $30 per trip. But new models with bigger \npayloads, longer ranges, and faster speeds may bring the cost \ndown to only $7, competitive with same-day delivery, and with \na vastly longer reach. Conclusion \nAlthough nascent, this still-evolving convergence of retail and \nindustrial is reshaping the commercial real estate landscape\u2014\ndriven by changing preferences and enabled by technologies \nranging\tfrom\tapps\tand\tartificial\tintelligence\tto\tdrones\tand \t\nrobotics.

Seven of the top 20 markets in 2024 did not \nrepeat this year. On the other hand, only one leading market in \n2023 fell from the top 20 in 2024. \nThis volatility shows that industry participants are discerning \nin their assessments and are taking fresh perspectives as they \nperceive that market conditions or outlooks change. In the \nwords of a leading industry academic and advisor, \u201cGeography \nmatters more than ever.\u201d \nBigger Is (Mostly) Better, Especially in \nthe Sun Belt \nThe top-rated category in our survey this year remains the \nSuper Sun Belt markets. (See the Grouping the Markets section \nbelow\tfor\ta\tdefinition\tof\tour\tmarket\tcategories.)\t Though\tthe \t\naverage score dropped marginally, every market ranks in \nthe top 20, and all but one rank in the top 10 (San Antonio \nat number 13). Perhaps more revealing is that this category \nincludes all four top-ranked markets, starting with Dallas/Fort \nWorth, which returns to the top spot it last occupied in 2019 \nafter hovering in the top three the last two years. \nIt\u2019s not only large Sun Belt markets that are feeling the love. \nThe mean population size of the 10 highest-rated markets \nis\t10\tpercent\tgreater\tthis\tyear\tthan\tlast,\treflecting\tthat\tmore \t\nof the nation\u2019s largest metro areas are now rated as among \nthe most preferred markets. This go-big trend likely helps \nexplain the jump in Snow Belt markets among the highest-\nrated markets in the country: the net number of Midwest and \nNortheast markets in the top 20 increased from just two in the \npast two years to six this year\u2014the highest in over a decade\u2014\nwith all six being part of metropolitan areas having at least 4 \nmillion people. Several of these markets recorded some of the \nlargest score gains this year, including four in the New York metro area led by Manhattan and Brooklyn in New York City \nproper and the nearby Long Island and Jersey City markets. \nOverall, this marks a remarkable turnout for New York. As \nrecently as the Emerging Trends  2022 report\u2014released \nin October 2021 with the nation still in the throes of the \npandemic\u2014Manhattan had fallen to 42nd place and even last \nyear ranked only 31st. This year, the economic powerhouse \nmoved up to be one of the top markets at number 11. Other \nNew York metro markets have shown similar advances. \nAt the same time, a net of two Sun Belt markets fell from the \nleaderboard,\tthe\tfirst\tdecline\tsince\tthe\tpandemic.\tSun\tBelt \t\nmarkets are hardly out of favor and still account for 13 of the \ntop 20-rated markets. However, it should be noted that just \ntwo states\u2014Texas and Florida\u2014are home to eight of those 13, \nincluding all of the top four. Rounding out the other markets in \nthe top four aside from Dallas/Fort Worth are Miami, Houston, \nand Tampa/St. Petersburg. \nFlorida, in particular, is on a roll. The state has 10 markets in \nour coverage universe, and seven registered double-digit gains \nin the rankings this year. These include Miami, which soared \n12 places to number 2, Tampa/St. Petersburg, which moved \nup 14 places to number 4, and Orlando, jumping 13 spots to \nnumber 6 overall. In addition, Fort Lauderdale re-entered the \ntop\t20,\tmoving\tup\tfive\tplaces\tto\tnumber\t16.\tOnly\t Tallahassee \t\nand Southwest Florida bucked the trend. Still, as we noted \nin our migration trend (Now Where?), in-migration has either \nmoderated or reversed in several of these key Florida markets, \nsuggesting the outlook could soon weaken, particularly if \nclimate costs continue to rise. \nMore Support for the Niche and \nBackbone Markets \nIn this section, we review how the various Emerging Trends  \ncategories and subgroups performed. Every subgrouping in \nthe Magnets and Establishment categories scored lower this \nyear than last, continuing their slide from the 2023 survey. At \nthe same time, every subgrouping in the Niche and Backbone \ncategories scored higher this year, reversing their declines in \nthe prior year.

Several of these markets were in the top 20 markets \nin\tthe\t2024\tsurvey,\tand\tall\tare\tnow\tsuffering\tfrom\tsignificant \t\ndomestic out-migration. \nHousing affordability also may be weighing down the \nSupernova markets.

The generally smaller markets of \nthe Affordable West registered the biggest gains in the 2025 \nsurvey, along with the Boutique Markets situated mainly in the \nMidwest and South. Albuquerque, Des Moines, Knoxville, and \nOmaha were some of the biggest gainers. \nOn the other hand, the Multitalented Producers recorded the \ngreatest declines\u2014despite the \u201cbigger is better\u201d trend. All four \nof these very populous markets fell by double-digits in the \nrankings. No one factor explains all of them, but three of the \nmarkets are on the West Coast, which almost uniformly lost \nappeal in the survey this year, especially for larger metro areas. \nThe 18-Hour Cities group also lost a lot of ground this year. \nFive of the seven markets saw their ranking slide, with Denver, \nSan Diego, and Portland, Oregon, falling the most.

Dallas/Fort Worth\nOften referred to as DFW by locals, the Dallas/Fort Worth \nmetroplex is the most populous MSA in the state of \nTexas and the fourth largest in the nation. DFW is the \nfourth-fastest growing city, with a population increase \nof 6.1 percent between 2020 and July 2023, trailing only \nJacksonville, Raleigh, and Austin.\nGiven its size and continued demographic growth, it is not \nsurprising that real estate investors have targeted DFW.

Known for its nightlife, beaches, and diverse culture, \ntourism is a major economic driver for the metro area. \nPortMiami is the world\u2019s second busiest cruise port by \npassenger count\u2014edged out only by Orlando to the north\u2014\nand home to major cruise lines.\nLess well-known is the city\u2019s status as a major cargo port. \nMany goods pass through Miami warehouses on the way to \nand from the Caribbean and Latin America. Miami\u2019s pivotal \nrole in shipping routes bolsters its industrial sector. Green \nStreet expects logistics same store rent growth in Miami to \nreach over 3.5 percent per year through 2028, the highest \namong the nation\u2019s top 50 markets.\nOngoing demand from international arrivals and wealthy \nbuyers alike has driven explosive growth in Miami\u2019s housing \nmarket. Home prices have risen 80 percent since the \nonset of the pandemic. This, combined with a subsequent \n400-basis-point rise in mortgage rates, has sunk housing \naffordability to a four-decade low. Moody\u2019s Analytics rates \nMiami\u2019s relative cost of living at 122 percent of the national \naverage, higher even than New York City\u2019s 119 percent. \nAs a result of this high cost of living, Miami has become \none of the few Florida markets experiencing domestic net \noutmigration, primarily to more affordable communities in \nthe state. Continued high international arrivals are more than compensating, however. Moody\u2019s expects population \ngrowth in the metro area to amount to between 0.5 percent \nand\t1.0\tpercent\tper\tyear\tfor\tat\tleast\tthe\tnext\tfive\tyears, \t\ndespite cost-driven net domestic outmigration.\nMiami\u2019s strengths have granted its institutional real estate \nmarket resilience in the face of a challenging interest rate \nenvironment.

Employment \nhas expanded at a slightly faster pace than the nation over \nthe past 10 years, thanks to outsized growth in several of the \nmarket\u2019s private-sector industries. Health care has been a \nmajor contributor to the metro area\u2019s diversity as the sector \nhas expanded to meet demand from a growing population \nbase. The city is home to the Texas Medical Center (TMC), \none of the world\u2019s largest medical complexes, spanning \n50 million square feet and home to more than 120,000 \nemployees. TMC is also a hot bed for research and health \ncare innovation. Another dominant economic driver in the \nmetro area is the Port of Houston. Situated along the Gulf \nCoast, the Port of Houston is the largest port in the country \nin terms of tonnage and the 16th largest in the world. The \nHouston Ship Channel is estimated to generate more than $439 billion in statewide economic value, representing nearly \n20 percent of Texas\u2019s gross domestic product. \nHouston\u2019s transformation is well supported by demographic \ntrends. With a current population of more than 7 million, the \nHouston\tMSA \tis\tthe\tfifth\tlargest\tin\tthe\tnation\tand\tthe\tsecond \t\nlargest in Texas, behind the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex. As \nof July 2023, the Houston MSA saw the second largest year-\nover-year population gains in the country, surpassing other \nfast-growing metro areas such as Atlanta, Orlando, Charlotte, \nand Phoenix. This growth is expected to continue as Moody\u2019s \nforecasts the metro area\u2019s population will grow by 1.4 percent \nannually over the next 10 years, 100 basis points faster than \nthe nation\u2019s expected pace over the same period. While \nthis growth is likely the product of an expanding economy, \nresidents are also attracted to the metro area\u2019s relative \naffordability. Houston\u2019s cost of living index is 28 percent \nbelow the average of the most populous MSAs. The metro \narea also boasts above-average diversity with more than 90 \nnations represented in its population. This diverse community \nis one of the factors that drove Houston to overtake Miami \nin FT-Nikkei\u2019s annual ranking of best U.S. cities for foreign \nmultinationals to do business. The number 1 ranking was \nalso supported by the metro area\u2019s business-friendly policies, \nstrength in logistics, and relative affordability.\nLooking ahead, the metro area\u2019s existing energy \ninfrastructure and dominant port system position it to \nbe a leader in the nation\u2019s transition to green energy. \nAdditionally, its unique lack of formal zoning laws makes \nfor a particularly development-friendly environment.

The metropolitan area has seen \nrobust population growth over the past decade, gaining \nnearly 200,000 residents, and rising from the 83rd largest \nMSA in 2010 to the 71st largest in 2023. In addition, the \ncity attracts approximately 15 million visitors annually, \naccounting for a $12.8 billion economic impact in 2022 and \nnearly a quarter of the region\u2019s overall economy. \nCharleston\u2019s growth is underpinned by robust economic \nfundamentals. Since 2014, employment has increased at \na compound annual growth rate of 2.9 percent, more than \ndouble the national average. Tourism is a critical part of \nCharleston\u2019s economy, with leisure and hospitality payrolls \naccounting for an above-average share of both employment \nand\toutput.\t The\teasing\tof\tinflation\tpressures\talong\twith \t\nthe\trapid\tinflux\tof\tnew\u2014and\twealthier\u2014residents\tinto \t\nSouth Carolina and the Southeast will boost the tourism \nbase and spending over the coming years. Charleston\u2019s \npostpandemic recovery has been strong. Between August \n2023 and July 2024, Charleston\u2019s employment surged by \n5.0 percent, securing its position as the second-fastest \ngrowing job market in the nation over the period, surpassed \nonly by Merced, California.Charleston has also become a regional hub for \nmanufacturing and logistics, particularly in the aerospace \nand automotive industries. Since 2021, manufacturing jobs \nhave increased by 21 percent, driven by major employers \nand investments in electric vehicle production, helping to \ndiversify the city\u2019s economic base. The local economy also \nbenefits\tfrom\tthe\tPort\tof\tCharleston,\tthe\tsixth\tlargest\tport\t\nin the United States by container volume as of 2023 and \ngrowing.

Revered as the \nbirthplace of jazz, New Orleans is known primarily as an \nentertainment and culture destination but is also a major \nhub for the oil and gas industry. New Orleans\u2019s ranking in \nthe Emerging Trends  report has historically been below \naverage but has recently taken strides toward the middle \nof the pack, reaching 42nd among all 81 markets for 2025. \nThis is up an impressive 25 spots from its previous ranking.\nDespite its momentum, the city faces challenges. \nEmployment in New Orleans has yet to recover to \nprepandemic levels. Total employment was around 565,000 \nas of Q2 2024, still 3.4 percent below Q4 2019 levels. This still-\nrecovering trend illustrates the local economy\u2019s susceptibility \nto boom/bust cycles in major industries such as energy and \ntourism. Net migration to the city has also been subdued \nsince the pandemic, and above-average employment volatility \nrelative to the United States has contributed to wage growth \nthat is both slowing and below the regional average. The \ncity\u2019s real gross metropolitan output has also declined by a \ncompound\tannual\tgrowth\trate\t(CAGR)\tof\t\u20131.6\tpercent\tsince \t\n2014. About 17.5 million travelers visited the city and spent \njust over $9 billion in 2022, which is still modestly below the \n19.8 million visitors and $10 billion of spending recorded in \n2019. This has weighed on New Orleans\u2019s recovery, as the \ntourism industry is estimated to generate nearly 40 percent of \nthe city\u2019s operating budget.\nMore positively, New Orleans remains an affordable place to \ndo business. Moody\u2019s Analytics rates its relative cost of doing \nbusiness at 90 percent of the national average. Business \ncosts in other Southeast Gulf Coast metro areas including \nHouston, Tampa, and even Atlanta are higher, rating 97, 95, \nand 93 percent, respectively. With an above-average share of \nbaby boomers comprising its local population, the city of New \nOrleans has an outsized share of health care industry jobs \nrelative to the state and nation. Also contributing to the local \neconomy is the city\u2019s well-developed port, pipeline, and rail \ninfrastructure, being the only U.S. city with a rail gateway that \nserves six major Class 1 railroads. Port NOLA saw a record \n19 percent year-over-year increase in container shipping volumes for Q3 of FY24, citing continued investment in port \ninfrastructure\tand\timproved\tthroughput\tefficiency.\tBoth\tstate \t\nand federal government infrastructure investments totaling \nmore than $500 million are being directed toward projects \nimproving port capacity, such as a new downriver container \nterminal and the Louisiana International Terminal (LIT). \nChallenged economic growth is likely to continue over \nthe near term. Moody\u2019s Analytics forecasts net migration \ninto New Orleans to turn negative following 2024, losing \napproximately 34,000 residents in total through 2029, and \nat an accelerating pace. The city remains a more affordable \nplace to live compared to other Gulf Coast metro areas, \nbut rising home insurance costs across the state because \nof\tclimate-related\trisks,\tsuch\tas\tflooding\tand\theavy\tstorm \t\ndamage, are impacting homeowners. Average home \ninsurance costs in Louisiana are 42 percent higher than the \nnational average of about $2,478 annually, ranking the state \nas the eighth highest by that measure.\nNew Orleans will likely remain dependent on boom-and-\nbust industries such as tourism, energy, and shipping for \nthe foreseeable future, and as a result it may continue to \nsee\tfluctuations\tin\tperformance.\tDemographic\tchallenges \t\nand exposure to natural disasters underpin investors\u2019 \nhesitancy to bet on NOLA. However, the city\u2019s recent \nmomentum in the Emerging Trends  rankings could indicate \nthat more market players are seeing opportunities in its \nmore long-term growth sectors, such as health care.\nNote: New Orleans is not included in NPI reporting, and \nreturn figures are unavailable.\nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 202596Market Descriptions \u2013 Appendix\nGrouping the Markets\nThe Emerging Trends  survey covers 81 geographic markets, \nwhich are sorted into major categories and subgroups to \nfacilitate the analysis of these markets. \nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 202597\nChapter 3: Markets to WatchMagnets\nMagnet markets are migration destinations for both people \nand companies, and most are growing more quickly than the \nU.S. average in terms of both population and jobs.

These markets are large and diverse but still \nrelatively affordable for big metro areas, forming powerhouse \neconomies that attract a wide range of businesses. Despite \ntheir large population bases, most are among the fastest-\ngrowing markets in the country. Moreover, their economic \nperformance has been solid through thick and thin.\nThis dynamic helps explain the popularity of these markets in \nthe Emerging Trends  survey. These metro areas collectively \nhave maintained the highest average rating of any subgroup in \nterms of overall prospects for the last four years.

Interviewees most commonly cite \nthe solid growth prospects, business-friendly environment, \naffordable housing, and good quality of life as reasons for the \npopularity of these metro areas.\n18-Hour Cities.  Metro areas in this now-classic Emerging \nTrends  category faired relatively well during the pandemic \nrecession, a testament to their enduring appeal. Though \ngrowing less affordable over time\u2014partly due to price \npressures from transplants from more expensive \nEstablishment markets\u2014these medium-sized cities nonetheless continue to attract in-migration due to lifestyle, \nworkforce quality, and development opportunities, according \nto ULI interviews. Measured by per capita Gross Metropolitan \nProduct (GMP), workers here are the most productive of any \nsubgroup in the fast-growing Magnets category.\nThe 18-Hour Cities are scattered throughout the country, \ncomprising a more geographically diverse set of markets \nthan the other subgroups. The 18-Hour City markets include \nCharlotte, Denver, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Portland (Oregon), Salt \nLake City, San Diego, and Fort Lauderdale. Features common \nto all are active downtowns and urban-like suburban nodes.\nThe dynamic economies of these markets continue to make \nthem popular with developers and investors alike. Three of \nthe seven markets in this grouping rate among the top 20 \nmarkets nationally for overall prospects, led by Salt Lake City \n(which jumped from number 30 last year to 9), followed by \nFort Lauderdale and Charlotte. However, three of the markets \nin this group fell sharply in the ratings this year: Denver, San \nDiego, and especially Portland, Oregon, which fell 29 places to \nnumber 80\u2014the second lowest of all markets. However, as a \ngroup, the 18-Hour Cities still rate third-highest among the 12 \nsubgroups, moving ahead of the Multitalented Producers of \nthe Establishment markets category this year despite suffering \nthe second-greatest decline in average rating.\nSupernovas.

Like the astronomic \nsource\tfor\tits\tname,\tthe\tfive\tmetro\tareas\tin\tthe\tSupernova \t\ncategory markets have exploded into prominence over the \npast decade or so.

However, the appeal of these markets to investors \nand developers has waned in recent years as growth has \nslowed across many of these markets while challenges have \nincreased. Their ratings and rankings both fell this year.\nMultitalented Producers.  Though all the Establishment \nmarkets are large and economically varied, some are more \ndiverse\tthan\tothers,\tspecifically\tthe\tmultitalented\tmetro\tareas \t\nof Chicago, Los Angeles, San Jose, and Seattle.

But make no \nmistake: workers here tend to be productive, with per capita \nGMP ranking the second highest of any subgroups. Though \ntheir elevated cost of doing business and getting deals done \nlimits their appeal for some real estate professionals, the \nMultitalented Producers nonetheless attract a disproportionate \nshare of investment dollars.\nRatings for these markets have been volatile in recent years, \nprimarily due to the changing fortunes of the tech sector, \nwhich\tfigures\theavily\tin\tthese\teconomies.\t This\twas\tan \t\nespecially bad year for these markets. The rankings of all four \nmarkets dropped by about 10 or more places. Los Angeles and \nSeattle both tumbled out of the top 20, while San Jose dropped \n27 places to number 60. Together, the ratings of these markets \nfell the least of any subgroup for the third year in a row. This subgroup now rates just the sixth highest of the 12 groups, \ndown from third last year.\nKnowledge and Innovation Centers.  This grouping serves \nas the focus of intellectual capital in the economy, whether \nin\tsocial\tmedia\t(San\tFrancisco),\tfinance\t(Manhattan), \t\nbiosciences (Boston), or think tanks (Washington, D.C.). With \nthe most educated workforces in the county, these innovation \ncenters are by far the most productive, with per capita GMP \nmore than twice that of any other subgroup and three times \nthe national average.\nThis group also has some of the country\u2019s most expensive \nhousing and the highest costs of doing business. Lofty \nasset prices have cut investor appeal for most of these \nmarkets, especially as growth has slowed in recent years. \nThese markets also bore the brunt of out-migration from \ndense, expensive central business districts (CBDs) during the \npandemic, though most are recovering to various degrees. The \noverall rating for this group declined moderately this year, but \nthis average masks the divergent fortunes of the individual \nmarkets. As noted in the chapter overview, Manhattan soared \nback into investor favor this year, jumping 20 places to number \n11. Boston was stable and remained in the top 10.

This group includes the markets \nsurrounding high-cost CBDs in Los Angeles, Miami, New \nYork City, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. Though most \nare suburban in character, some are more urban. Moreover, \nseveral are or contain metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) \nor divisions in their own right: Northern New Jersey (Newark, \nNJ/PA metropolitan division), Inland Empire (Riverside/\nSan Bernardino/Ontario, California, MSA); the Maryland \nsuburbs outside Washington, D.C., (Frederick/Gaithersburg/\nRockville metropolitan division), and Northern Virginia, outside \nWashington,\tD.C.\t(Arlington\u2013Alexandria\u2013Reston,\tVA\u2013WV \t\nMetropolitan Division), among others. \nMany\tof\tthese\tmarkets\tbenefited\tfrom\tthe\tout-migration \t\nfrom their neighboring CBDs during the pandemic, and their \nprospects have improved somewhat in the eyes of survey \nrespondents. But here, too, there is a diversity in trends as half \nof the 12 markets improved this year and half declined. The \nNew York City metro area is now garnering more support, with Emerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 2025100Brooklyn, Jersey City, and Long Island all registering big gains \nand moving into the top 20. By contrast, California\u2019s Inland \nEmpire\tand\tOakland/East\tBay\tmarkets\tdropped\tsignificantly, \t\nthough Orange County fell only slightly. The two Washington, \nD.C., markets declined (along with the District itself in the \nprior\u00a0category).\nNiche Markets\nAs\tbefitting\ttheir\tmoniker,\tNiche\tmarkets\tare\tgenerally \t\nsmaller or less economically diverse than the Magnets \nand Establishment markets but typically have a dominant \neconomic driver that supports stable economic growth. This \ngroup ranks third among the four major market groups in \nterms of investor outlooks but far behind the Magnet and \nEstablishment groups.\nBoutique markets are smaller cities with innovative or unique \ndevelopments that coordinate well with their economic and \ndemographic\tprofiles.\tHowever,\tthe\tdemographics\tin\tthese \t\nmarkets\u2014with fewer millennials and more seniors\u2014tend to \nbe less favorable for economic growth. Eds and Meds is an \noft-used term to describe areas with sizable education and/\nor health care facilities. Finally, Convention and Visitor Centers \nmarkets focus on tourism, conventions, and, in some cases, \nthe retirement and second-home market. \nBoutique Markets.  These are smaller markets with lively \ndowntowns; diversity in leisure, cultural, and natural/outdoor \namenities; and stable economic bases that withstood the \nCOVID-19 downturn better than many markets. These markets \noffer a lower cost of living and cost of doing business in a \ndiverse range of settings, primarily noncoastal. Chattanooga, \nDes Moines, Greenville, Knoxville, Omaha, and Portland (Maine) \nall have populations of less than 1 million, and all maintained \ntheir previous positive in-migration during the pandemic, \nindicating the appeal of these towns. \nRichmond remains the top-rated market in this subgroup and \ncontinues to attract substantial residential and commercial \ndevelopment. Five of the seven markets in this grouping \nearned higher overall scores this year. For the group as a \nwhole, the average score improved the second most of \nany\u00a0group.\nEds and Meds.  Before the pandemic, Eds and Meds markets \nwere envied for their desirable combination of stability (large \nuniversities) and growth (health care). COVID-19 initially dented \ntheir reputations as both education and medicine suffered disproportionately during the pandemic. However, demand for \neducation and health care\u2014and the facilities that house them\u2014\nhave resumed their growth. Ratings and rankings for these \nmarkets improved in concert with the other Niche subgroups \nthis year. Columbus is a standout here, jumping 22 places to \nnumber 31. Other Ohio markets in other groups also rose.\nThis category includes markets with a strong base of \nmajor universities, highly ranked health care systems, or \nboth\u2014Baltimore, Columbus, Gainesville, Madison, Memphis, \nPittsburgh, and Tallahassee.

But as with much of the \nsentiment expressed in recent Emerging Trends  reports, the \nindustry outlook for the year ahead remains mixed, as is \nevident in the following quotations:\n\u201cThings can\u2019t get that much worse,\u201d said one interviewee, who \nnevertheless expects business conditions to start to improve \nafter hitting bottom.\n\u201cI cannot think of another business that I\u2019d like to be in right \nnow,\u201d said a Calgary interviewee.\nThe\tsecond\tquote\treflects\tthe\tincreasingly\twarm\tsentiment\t\ntoward Calgary, where a strong economy and rapid population \ngrowth have helped make this the top market to watch in this \nyear\u2019s survey of Canadian real estate companies.

While developers and lenders have \nin many cases found ways to stave off more drastic actions \nlike receiverships, uncertainty remains about how long they\u2019ll be able to do so\u2014even with interest rates coming down. Many \ncompanies have already accounted for interest rate cuts in \ntheir investment underwriting and development plans, while \nother pressures (such as building costs, reduced investor \ndemand, regulatory challenges, and labour shortages) continue \nto affect project viability.\nThese trends are emblematic of the broader shift in Canada\u2019s \nreal estate market since interest rates have remained higher \nfor longer than the industry hoped or believed would be \nthe\tcase.\tSimply\tput,\tas\thigher\tfinancing\tcosts\tcompound \t\nother industry pressures and investors weigh real estate \ninvestment against other opportunities offering attractive \nreturns with less risk, the sector is less compelling than it was \nduring the previous period of strong returns and cheap and \nplentiful\u00a0capital.Emerging Trends Barometer 2025\nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 2025104These trends contributed to a broader perception that \nmany investors are less willing to take risks in real estate. \nWith growth opportunities from real estate harder to \nfind,\tthe\treturns\tfrom\tlower-risk\tinvestments\tcan\tappear \t\nmore\u00a0attractive.\nYet several interviewees noted some investors see \nopportunities to put capital to work when public markets \nare seized up and competition from Canadian pension fund \ninvestors is lower than in previous years.

But there are lots of buts and \ncaveats, depending on who you are. \u201d\nSo far, interest rates haven\u2019t come down as quickly as some \nhad predicted a year ago. And several interviewees said banks \nare adopting more conservative lending standards due to \neconomic and regulatory pressures, such as the higher capital \nreserve requirements mandated under the Basel III Accord.\nStill, our survey shows a somewhat more balanced outlook \nfor capital availability in 2025, especially when looking at debt \nversus equity. And while our 2024 Emerging Trends in Real \nEstate\u00ae report found debt funds were a growing opportunity \nfor investors amid constrained capital markets, there was less \ndiscussion about them this year.\nOverall, interviewees painted a nuanced picture of the outlook \nfor 2025, with many noting an emerging bifurcation in capital \navailability based on a borrower\u2019s credit quality and banking \nrelationships. Many large real estate investors say they can still \naccess loans but see banks applying greater scrutiny. \u201cLoans \nthat used to take 30 to 60 days to be underwritten now take \nfour months. There are more boxes to check and questions \nto answer,\u201d said one residential developer. Conversely, smaller \nand less established real estate companies face higher \ncapital\u00a0constraints.\nEven so, the current environment creates new opportunities for \nprivate\tinvestors\u2014including\tfamily\toffices\tand\thigh-net-worth \t\nindividuals\u2014to\tprovide\tcapital\tto\tprojects\tthat\tface\tfinancing \t\ngaps\tor\tchallenges.\tIn\taddition\tto\tfilling\trefinancing\tgaps,\tsome \t\nare moving up the capital stack and providing mezzanine \nfinance,\ttranche\tcredit,\tand\tsubordinate\tdebt\u2014frequently\tin \tA\trange\tof\tother\tfactors\tis\talso\tinfluencing\treal\testate\tbusinesses \t\nand prospects.

While real estate companies have been dealing with \nthe implications of these trends for some time, strong signals \nindicate they\u2019ll only grow in importance in the coming years.\nAs challenging as the current environment may be, real estate \ncompanies with a strong conviction about where the market is \ngoing, based on a deep understanding of these fundamental \ntrends, will be in the best position to seize opportunities, \nstrengthen their operations and management teams, build \nresilience, and create value. For some, this will involve changes \nto improve their existing businesses as they assess how the \nmarket evolves in 2025.

Those that are not reeling are rethinking, \nrepositioning and seizing opportunities. \u201d\nTo some, 2024 felt like the real estate industry\u2019s most \nchallenging year in recent memory. Reduced credit \navailability\u2014especially for new entrants\u2014as well as heightened \ngeopolitical risks, uncertain property valuations, and interest \nrates that remained higher for longer than many expected left \nthe sector with \u201ca crippling sense of uncertainty\u201d heading into \n2025, as one interviewee put it.\nSeveral interviewees observed a decrease in domestic capital \navailable for real estate investments. Many pension funds, \ninsurers, and other institutions reached or exceeded their real \nestate allocation limits and moved capital into other sectors \nand markets. Some also restructured their management \nplatforms and are working more with private fund managers. \nMeanwhile, many real estate investment trusts (REITs) traded \nat\ta\tsignificant\tdiscount\tto\ttheir\tnet\tasset\tvalues,\thindering \t\ntheir ability to raise capital or pursue accretive acquisitions.Emerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 2025105\nChapter 4: Emerging Trends in Canadian Real EstateDealmaking in a Period of Adjustment: How Investors Are \nBridging the Gap\n\u201cThere has to be a reset on valuation expectations before we \ncan start trading again. \u201d\nMany commercial real estate investors found themselves on \nthe sidelines in 2024 as the environment of price discovery \ncontinued. Sizeable bid-ask price spreads, exacerbated by \ndistressed sales that further clouded property valuations, acted \nas a drag on transaction volumes. Property owners\u2014particularly \nthose with well performing leases in place\u2014remained reluctant \nto sell at a discount and crystallize valuation losses. At the same \ntime, the persistently narrow spread between capitalization \nrates and bond yields reduced the attractiveness of potential \npurchases for investors.

They include the following:\nPrivate equity from family offices and similar organizations \nwill be highly visible: Many interviewees said private investors, \nparticularly\tfamily\toffices\tand\tprivate\tequity\tfunds,\twill\tbe \t\namong the more active buyers in 2025 amid the pullback by \npension funds, insurers, and REITs. \u201cDomestic institutional \ninvestors will not be the cause of transactions,\u201d one interviewee \nsaid. \u201cIt will be private equity. REITS are out of the game, and \ninstitutional owners are overweight.\u201d Another interviewee \nsuggested this dynamic would push property prices down as \nprivate buyers face limited competition for assets.\nBuying opportunities for foreign investors:  A smaller pool of \npotential domestic buyers is also creating opportunities for \nforeign investors. Canada\u2019s population growth is catching the \nattention of many investors, particularly those in the United \nStates and Western Europe. This trend is already gathering \nmomentum: overall foreign direct investment in Canadian real \nestate, rentals, and leasing from U.S. investors climbed 15.3 \npercent\tin\t2022\u20132023,\taccording\tto\tStatistics\tCanada.\tIn\tthe \t\nfirst\thalf\tof\t2024,\tsome\tU.S.\tinvestors\tannounced\tbig\tbets\ton \t\nCanada\u2019s\tmultifamily\tresidential\tmarket.\tOn\tthe\tflip\tside,\tsome \t\nCanadian interviewees are looking abroad for opportunities, \nwith several focusing on the United States due to what they \ndescribed as a more favorable regulatory environment and \nfaster development timelines. Similarly, Canadian tax changes \nand reporting requirements could temper the enthusiasm of \nforeign investors assessing emerging opportunities in Canada.\nPreparing to take advantage of emerging distress:  Several \ninterviewees said they plan to focus on strengthening down\t50\tpercent\tover\tthe\tfirst\ttwo\tquarters\tof\t2024\twhen \t\ncompared with the same period in 2023, according to Colliers. \n(The\treal\testate\tservices\tfirm\tnoted\tthat\tfigure\tdrops\tto\t25 \t\npercent when a single megadeal from 2023 is excluded.)\nSeveral interviewees said the gap between buyers and \nsellers is narrowing.

Now, in a time of stagnant \nand even declining prices, alternative assets often offer \nmore compelling returns. This is especially true when \ncondo rental rates in markets like Toronto have softened, \nat least in the short term, and in some cases have declined. \nMeanwhile, high interest rates are suppressing demand \nfrom end users. Many potential buyers are adopting a \nwait-and-see approach, hoping for further price corrections \nand lower interest rates. The price gap between existing \ncondos and preconstruction units has also widened, further \nweakening presale activity. \nOn the supply side, developers are grappling with elevated \nconstruction and borrowing costs. Capital availability has \nalso tightened as lenders become increasingly cautious \ntoward condo projects. Additionally, reports of increasing \nnumbers of preconstruction buyers pursuing assignment \nsales suggest condo builders are struggling to close sales \non newly completed projects.

It also \nreported that the number of condos under construction fell to a three-year low of 87,508\u2014a year-over-year decline of \nalmost 19,000 units. \nThese forces are exposing a widening market bifurcation. \nOn one side are larger, well-capitalized developers with \nstrong balance sheets and sizeable land banks.

Indeed, \ndevelopers postponed 76 projects\u2014representing 24,335 \nunits\u2014between 2022 and mid-2024 in the Greater Toronto \nand Hamilton Area alone, according to Urbanation. On the \nother side are small- and mid-sized developers that may \nnot\thave\tthe\treserves\tneeded\tto\tnavigate \tgrowing\tfinancial \t\npressures. \nWith land trading at relatively lower prices, developers under \nfinancial\tpressure\tare \tlooking\tto\tsell\tproperties\tonly\tas\ta \t\nlast resort.

These opportunities appeal to investors \nwith\ta\tfirm\tbelief\tthat\tchanging\tconsumer,\ttechnological,\tand \t\nbusiness trends will create new real estate requirements.\nSeveral interviewees highlighted the growing need for data \ncentres to support the adoption of emerging technologies, \nsuch as generative AI, cloud computing, and the internet of \nthings\u2014all\tof\twhich\trequire\tsignificant\tcomputing\tpower.\tReal \t\nestate investors and operators can create value in multiple \nways that go beyond new site development. They also \nhave opportunities to add value to existing data centres by \nenhancing lease and operational performance, strengthening \nsustainability attributes, and reinforcing security measures.Another example is cold-storage facilities, which combine \ntraditional industrial real estate with increasingly technology-\nenabled logistics and distribution systems. Some real estate \nobservers believe more cold-storage facilities are needed \nto feed a growing population that PwC\u2019s recent Voice of the \nConsumer Survey  showed is looking to boost its intake of fresh \nfruits and vegetables. Cold-storage facilities are also needed to \nsupport online grocery shopping and meal kit delivery services, \nnot to mention storing exports of fresh and frozen food.\nThese opportunities won\u2019t appeal to every investor. Data \ncentres\u2014which combine elements of infrastructure, real \nestate, and technology\u2014have unique tenancy risks and high \nbuild-out costs. They also require large amounts of energy, \npointing to the need for sustainable solutions that draw on \nnew and existing sources of clean electricity. In the case of \ncold storage, considerations include specialized requirements \nto\tmeet\tspecific\tuser\tneeds\tand\thigher\tcosts\tcompared\twith \t\nfacilities that store other types of goods.\nSuccessfully entering new markets in areas like real assets \nand niche properties often requires capabilities that may be \navailable by partnering with organizations with operational \nexpertise. One example is student housing, which several \ninterviewees cited as offering attractive opportunities. Some \nargue that investors haven\u2019t yet scaled Canada\u2019s student \nhousing sector to the same degree as in other countries, where \nlarge institutional operators have created nationally branded \nproviders. But this subsector comes with unique operational \nrequirements.

But even if \nmore opportunities arise, several interviewees said land \nprices still haven\u2019t come down enough to create a clear \npath to development since interest rates and construction \ncosts remain high. \u201cWe looked at over 50 land purchase deals\tover\tthe\tlast\t12\tmonths,\tand\tnone\tmade \tfinancial \t\nsense,\u201d said one Vancouver interviewee, adding that more \nreceiverships will likely emerge in 2025. \nDespite the challenging conditions, some interviewees \nnoted that strong population growth means the condo \nmarket will likely come back, creating opportunities for \nthose\twith\tsufficient\tpatience\tand\tcapital\tto\twait\tout\tthe \t\ndownturn.

Further Change Needed to Tackle \nthe Complex Affordability Crisis\n\u201cWe need a new deal for housing in Canada. \u201d\nAnother key trend reshaping Canadian real estate is housing \naffordability, an issue that\u2019s increasingly affecting industry \nplayers as the cost of buying and renting reaches the limits \nof what many Canadians can pay. The issue has taken centre \nstage on the policy front as governments at all levels across \nCanada announced a series of measures aimed at increasing \nsupply and addressing some of the concerns the industry has \nbeen raising for years.\nWhile some interviewees welcomed those moves, the overall \nsense from the industry is there\u2019s more work to do to address \na complex problem that has been building for some time. \n\u201cGovernment plans around affordability will have zero impact \nas they haven\u2019t solved the fundamental issue of cycle time \nand governmental approvals and taxes,\u201d said one interviewee.\nRecent\tstatistics\treflect\tthe\tchallenges\tat\thand\teven\twith\tthe \t\npolicy changes and the broader push to address the housing \ncrisis.

(CMHC) has estimated will be needed by 2030 \nto restore housing affordability in Canada.\nTrends in the condo market suggest further challenges ahead \nfor housing affordability as the downturn in that segment has \nled developers to pause plans to build new units. While new \ninventory has been coming to market due to previous condo \nstarts, the current slowdown could lead to a shortage of \nunits in the coming years as demand recovers amid declining \ninterest rates. All of this comes at a time when strong levels \nof population growth and household formation fuel further \ndemand, although the outlook continues to evolve in light \nof federal government changes to both permanent and \ntemporary resident arrivals to Canada.\nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 2025110Supply Barriers Persist\nThese are just some of the fundamental trends that will \nchallenge\tCanada\u2019s\tability\tto\tmake \tsignificant\theadway\ton \t\nhousing affordability, even with new supply-oriented policies. \nWhile some interviewees felt recent measures to encourage \nnew building are helpful, the overall sense was that the actions \nto date won\u2019t make a meaningful difference\u2014especially in the \nnear term\u2014because they haven\u2019t been big enough, are taking \ntoo long to implement, and fail to address key challenges.\nOn the federal side, interviewees are generally positive about \nthe government\u2019s move in 2023 to waive the goods and \nservices tax (GST) on new purpose-built rental housing. They \nalso say low-cost loans provided by CMHC in exchange for \naffordability components in new rental housing projects \nare helping close some of the gaps in being able to build \nnew supply. Those two actions are among a long list of \nfederal changes introduced recently to address Canada\u2019s \nhousing crisis. Other measures include plans to make \nfederal government lands available for housing development \nin exchange for affordability commitments. The federal \ngovernment is also allocating money to support new \ncooperative housing development and continues to roll \nout its Housing Accelerator Fund, which provides funding \nto municipalities that make changes aimed at facilitating \nnew\u00a0supply.\nSome provinces and municipalities are following suit with their \nown supply-side measures, such as allowing multiple units on \nland previously restricted to single-family housing and other \npolicy\tchanges\tto\tfacilitate \tdensification\tand\treduce\tbarriers \t\nto development. But while many of these measures could make a difference and, in some cases, create opportunities \nfor real estate companies to play a role, interviewees are \nseeing limited impacts so far. In some cases, governments \nannounce policy changes and funding support but take a \nlong time to implement them. Some federal initiatives, for \nexample, have been slow to roll out funding due to questions \nabout the methodology for counting new supply. And while \nzoning changes and broader legislative efforts to support new \ndevelopment are welcome, the reality on the ground is that \nprocesses in some cities for reviewing and approving new \nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 2025111\nChapter 4: Emerging Trends in Canadian Real Estateconstruction\u2014even\tthe\ttypes\tof\tdensification\tand\tinfill\tprojects \t\ngovernments say they encourage\u2014remain long and complex \nas planning departments continue to ask developers for large \nvolumes of information, plans, and studies.\nThose approval processes add to the expense of building \nhousing,\tas\tdo\tkey\tchallenges\tlike\tshortages\tof\tqualified \t\nlabour, a factor recently cited by Statistics Canada as \nhelping push up residential construction costs. While some \ninterviewees suggested the very tight labour market conditions of previous years have been easing amid the slowdown \nin housing starts, others had a different view. Among the \nlingering challenges are the quality of the work performed by \navailable labour, the lack of trades workers for the later stages \nof homebuilding, and competition for people from the large \nnumber of public infrastructure projects underway in Canada. \nThe expected wave of trades worker retirements in the coming \nyears will likely add more pressure on labour supply, so the \nindustry will face continuing challenges, especially when \nbuilding activity ramps back up.\nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 2025112Enabling Innovation and Productivity in Canadian Homebuilding\nWhile labour availability is a factor in pushing up costs, it\u2019s also \ntrue that Canada\u2019s building industry has a productivity challenge. \nAs CMHC reported recently, the number of workers per housing \nunit has increased over the past 25 years, suggesting declining \nproductivity in the sector. In fact, the federal agency noted that \nbuilding activity has lagged even as the number of workers \nbuilding homes in Canada was the highest ever in 2023.\nFindings like these further highlight the imperative to accelerate \ninnovation in Canada\u2019s real estate industry. The subject has been \nexplored in past Emerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae reports, and \nsome interviewees acknowledged its importance given the scale \nof the affordability crisis and its growing role in shaping the needs \nand expectations of Canadian renters and homebuyers. \u201cThe role \nof technology is very important when it comes to . . . building a \nhouse\tfaster\tand\tfinding\tnew\tways\tto\tbuild,\u201d\tsaid\tone\tinterviewee.\nOne solution mentioned by some interviewees is manufactured \nand modular housing. Modular housing has held only a small \nshare of Canada\u2019s market, even though off-site manufacturing \nrepresents\ta\tsignificant\topportunity\tto\treduce\tlabour \t\nrequirements, standardize building activities, and introduce \nautomations and other technological solutions that ultimately lead \nto faster construction and lower costs. Manufactured housing has \nbeen slow to gain ground in Canada for many reasons. High start-\nup and transportation costs, lack of standardization of building \ncodes, consumer preferences that limit demand, regulatory \nbarriers,\tand\tfinancing\tchallenges\tall\tcreate\tbarriers.\nPublic policy can help. Among other measures, governments \ncan streamline approvals for standardized designs and provide \nfinancing\tto\thelp\tscale\tinnovative\tsolutions.\tBut\tfor\talternatives \t\nlike manufactured housing to truly gain ground, the real estate \nindustry itself needs to be more open to change as these types \nof innovations involve building homes in very different ways that \nmay disrupt some of the existing players. The need to embrace \nnew approaches has been a long-standing issue in Canadian real \nestate, but the conditions for change may be more favourable \ngiven the growing acknowledgement of the urgency to address \naffordability, increased recognition by governments of the need \nfor more supportive policies, and greater awareness of examples \nof\tinnovations\tthat\tare\tboosting\tefficiency\tand\tproductivity.\nThat said, even though solutions to ease affordability \nchallenges are already available, successful adoption requires \nanother critical ingredient: skills. Real estate companies need a \nworkforce capable of identifying and executing new solutions, \nwhich many currently lack. In fact, 43 percent of real estate \nexecutives who participated in PwC\u2019s latest Global CEO Survey  \nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 2025113\nChapter 4: Emerging Trends in Canadian Real Estateidentified\ta\tlack\tof\tskills\tas\ta\tbarrier\tto\tmaking\tsignificant\t\nchanges to how they do business. Correcting this problem will \nrequire the industry to rethink workforce strategies and pursue \ncollaboration with external partners, such as educational \nproviders, to increase the availability of critical skills.\nFurther Changes Required\nWhile the need to accelerate innovation in homebuilding \nis critical, it\u2019s also true that the industry has been acting to \nmitigate affordability pressures. One interviewee discussed how \nmultigenerational homes are a solution, with families able to pool \nresources and share costs. This could mean building secondary \nsuites to provide housing for family members or to serve as an extra \nunit that homebuyers could rent out to help cover housing costs.\nThese efforts and innovations (construction technologies and \nbuilding methods such as modular housing) can help mitigate the \naffordability problem. However, interviewees emphasized that the \ncosts of many homebuilding inputs won\u2019t go down to the point \nof truly restoring affordability in Canada. Some pointed to the \nneed\tfor\tfurther\tinnovation\ton\tthe\tfinancing\tside\tby,\tfor\texample, \t\nmaking co-ownership options more available to Canadians. \nOne interviewee, noting that the key consideration for many \nCanadians is whether they can afford monthly mortgage costs, \nsuggested it\u2019s time to look at longer amortization periods. While \nthis\twould\tbe\ta\tsignificant\tchange\tfor\tCanadian\thomebuyers, \t\nthe interviewee pointed out that countries elsewhere in the world \nallow\tfor\tsignificantly\tlonger\tmortgages\tthan\tis\ttypical\tin\tCanada.Many\tof\tthese\tfinancing\tchanges\twould\trequire\tregulatory\t\naction, so here again governments play a key role. The need \nfor more concerted government action was a common theme \namong interviewees. Many emphasized the importance of \nreducing a key and growing cost in building housing over which \ngovernments have direct control: taxes, fees, and development \ncharges.\t The\tvarious\tlevies\tinvolved\tmake\tup\ta\tsignificant\t\nportion of the cost of a new home in many regions. In Ontario, \nfor example, a 2023 report from the Canadian Centre for \nEconomic Analysis found that taxation accounts for 31 percent \nof the price of a new home. Growing concern about this issue \nrecently led a group of Ontario developers to pledge to pass on \nsavings to consumers in exchange for reductions of taxes and \ncharges at the federal, provincial, and municipal levels.\nIn Focus: Accelerating Innovation \nthrough Generative AI\nAs housing affordability pressures reinforce the \ninnovation agenda in Canada\u2019s real estate market, the \nindustry is also eyeing another key driver of disruption \nthat has renewed the focus on business transformation \nand reinvention: generative AI. Generative AI is a branch \nof\tartificial\tintelligence\tthat\tcan\tgenerate,\ttransform,\tand\t\nsummarize content as well as automate many tasks \ncurrently done manually. Many interviewees see it as \na\tway\tto\tincrease\tefficiencies\tat\ta\ttime\tof\tsignificant\t\nbusiness pressures. But while the industry is exploring \nthe possibilities, interviewees said that, on the whole, \nthey\u2019re at the early stages of establishing governance, \npreparing their data, and testing out use cases.\n\u201cWe all tinker with it,\u201d said one interviewee, echoing the \nbroader sentiment that Canada\u2019s real estate industry has \nso far made only tentative steps toward adoption. Evidence \nof this wait-and-see approach can be found in PwC\u2019s \nGlobal CEO Survey , in which just 22 percent of real estate \nexecutives said their company had adopted generative AI.\nAmong those interviewees who are adopting the \ntechnology,\tmany\tare\tfinding\tconcrete\tapplications\t\nfor it. One interviewee is using it to create architectural \nrenderings much faster than in the past; another said the \ntechnology is helping developers with land due diligence. \nSome are looking to use generative AI to boost revenues: \none interviewee is developing an application that can \nmonitor rental supply and demand trends to help adjust \nrents based on geographic location.Emerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 20251143. Building a Sustainability and Climate \nResilience Strategy for the Future\n\u201cWhile we are 100 percent moving forward with ESG, we\u2019re \na bit paused at the moment. . . . It\u2019s difficult to incorporate \nadditional costs with limits on market pricing, and margins \nare already slim with high interest rates and cost escalation. \u201d\nAs the industry downturn deepens, Canadian real estate \ncompanies\tare\tfacing\tdifficult\tdecisions\tabout\thow\tto\trespond \t\nto the challenges associated with climate change. Even though \nsuccessive extreme weather events in Canada and around the \nworld have demonstrated the impacts of climate change, real \nestate players are divided on the path forward: in PwC\u2019s Global \nCEO Survey , 51 percent of real estate respondents said lower \nreturns are an inhibitor to decarbonizing their business model.Retrieving information to identify insights within documents \nis a key use case of generative AI that offers promising \napplications. Companies are using it for lease abstraction, for \nexample,\tto\tmore\tefficiently\tand\taccurately\tretrieve\tthe\tdata \t\nthey need. These tools use custom annotation models to \nscan and extract both structured and unstructured data from \nany type of lease, freeing employees from having to comb \nthrough\tlong\tdocuments\tto\tfind\tcritical\tterms\tand\tconditions.\nWith many Canadian real estate players at the earlier \nstages of adopting generative AI, they feel a growing sense \nof urgency to move faster to harness opportunities for \ncompetitive\tadvantage.\tWhile\tfinding\tnew\tefficiencies\tis\t\nimportant, the bigger opportunity is to use the technology \nto make more impactful changes to how they do business. \nInterviewees mentioned their interest in creating more \npersonalized and engaging customer experiences, \ngenerating fresh ideas and solutions, and expanding into \nnew markets and segments. For those looking for ways to \ncreate the most value from generative AI, key steps include \nthe following:\n\u2022 Identifying patterns in the most promising use cases: \nIdentifying the use cases that can generate the most \nvalue\u2014whether by increasing revenues, changing \nthe business model, or reducing costs\u2014is important. \nPinpointing patterns in use cases is particularly helpful \nbecause it allows companies to adapt their AI model to \na range of tasks.\u2022 Ensuring the quality and availability of key data:  \nData are the fuel for generative AI. The data need to be \naccurate, relevant, and available for use.\n\u2022 Implementing responsible AI practices and \ncontrols: Generative AI requires a high level of trust \nand accountability, both internally and externally. \nReal estate companies need to establish the right \ngovernance, security, controls, and ethical policies to \nensure responsible adoption of generative AI.\n\u2022 Developing a generative AI upskilling program:  As \nskill\trequirements\tchange\tand\tnew\tworkflows,\ttasks,\t\nand even jobs emerge, upskilling will be critical to \nengaging people in the AI journey. Part of the challenge \nis in helping workers see the upside to adopting \ngenerative\tAI\tin\tthe\tfirst\tplace.\tAccording\tto\t PwC\u2019s 2024 \nHopes and Fears Survey , 45 percent of Canadian real \nestate employee respondents said they weren\u2019t using \ngenerative\tAI\tbecause\tthey\tdidn\u2019t\tthink\tit\twould\tbenefit\t\ntheir careers. Shifting those perceptions will be key.\nThe scope of the considerations involved is leading some real \nestate companies to look at third-party vendors offering AI \nsolutions that may be easier to adopt. With an increasingly wide \nrange of players and solutions available in the AI ecosystem, \ncompanies\tmay\tsee\tsignificant\tvalue\tin\tconsidering\twhen\t\nthey might want to buy versus build a new tool and how \npartnerships\tcan\thelp\tthem\tunlock\tbigger\tbenefits\tfaster.\nOn one side are real estate companies, faced with high costs \nand interest rates, deciding to treat environmental, social, and \ngovernance (ESG) matters such as climate change as more of \na compliance issue than a strategic one. This approach was \nevident in the comments of several interviewees, including \none who said, \u201cThe degree to which you are distracted to \nkeep up with ESG disclosure will be negative for productivity \nand\u00a0growth.\u201d\nOn the other side, some interviewees view decarbonization as \nan important lever to reduce risk and maintain value in their \nreal estate assets. Among them are companies with higher \nlevels of exposure to large institutional tenants, investors, and \npublic\tstakeholders\u2014many\tof\twhom\tare\texerting\tsignificant \t\npressure to take actions like quantifying portfolio emissions \nand setting out detailed plans for how to reduce them.Emerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 2025115\nChapter 4: Emerging Trends in Canadian Real EstateDemographic forces are also at play. As many family-owned \nreal estate companies transition to the next generation or \nactively prepare to do so, there\u2019s growing interest among new \nowners and leaders in ESG matters like climate change and \nan acknowledgement of how important those issues will be to \nlong-term competitive advantage. As the physical effects of \nclimate change mount, the imperative to act is becoming even \nmore urgent.\nClimate Resilience Comes into Focus\nAmid the growing frequency and severity of disasters \n(wildfires,\tflooding,\thurricanes),\tthe\tlong-term\tresilience \t\nof real estate holdings is increasingly top of mind among \nstakeholders such as investors, regulators, and insurers.\nCompetitive advantage could go quickly (if not immediately) \nto real estate players that are able to assess and prepare \nfor the direct and indirect impacts of climate change. In this \nregard,\tthe\tfield\tis\trelatively\topen:\t PwC\u2019s 2024 Canadian \nESG Reporting Insights  found that 81 percent of Canadian \ncompanies\tdon\u2019t\tyet\tfinancially\tquantify\tclimate-related\trisks \t\nin their reporting. In a similar vein, PwC\u2019s latest Global CEO \nSurvey  found that only 5 percent of real estate executives \nsaid they had completed efforts to protect their assets and \nworkforce from the physical impacts of climate change.\nBut changes are coming to the way the real estate sector \nvalues assets relative to risk. Many investors are considering \nhow climate resilience will affect the exit price of their assets, \nfrom both a decarbonization and an adaptation perspective. \nAs a result, some are integrating climate risk and resilience \nassessments into their due diligence processes at the pre-\nacquisition stage and throughout the asset management \nlife\u00a0cycle.\nAt the same time, the industry is starting to see more localized \nefforts\tto\tretrofit\tassets\tand\tensure\tthe\tresilience\tof\tnew \t\nbuildings. Examples include the City of Toronto\u2019s Net Zero \nExisting Buildings Strategy, which requires building owners \nin Toronto to decarbonize existing buildings by 2040, and its \nGreen Standard, a set of sustainable design requirements that \napplies to all new private and city-owned developments. While \nToronto\u2019s Green Standard includes both requirements and \nvoluntary measures, those who achieve higher standards are \neligible\tfor\tfinancial\tincentives.Perhaps the greatest uncertainty surrounds pricing of and \naccess to insurance. With insurers subject to additional \nregulation\tunder\tthe\tOffice \tof\tthe\tSuperintendent\tof\tFinancial \t\nInstitutions\u2019 B-15 guideline on climate risk management, \nquestions abound about how its effects might trickle down \ninto insurance policies and pricing. In some cases, property \nowners\tmay\tface\tdifficult\tdecisions\tbetween\t(1)\tpaying\tfor \t\nwhat insurance carriers believe their physical and transition \nrisks to be; and (2) dealing with value erosion, if they decide \nto exit, because of changes in capitalization rates due to \nexposure to climate-related events.\nThe Path Forward to Climate Resilience\nReal estate companies ready to take the lead on climate \nresilience can start with a portfolio-level analysis to understand \ntheir priority risks and opportunities, from both a transition and \na physical risk perspective. The goal is to understand which \nproperties are most likely to be exposed to risk and then focus \nmitigation and adaptation efforts there.\nBecause climate hazards can affect property structure, \noccupants, and the surrounding area, the opportunity to \nconsider\tcommunity\tand\tasset\tresilience\ttogether\tis\tsignificant\t\nand, in many cases, untapped. Asset owners can look beyond \ntheir own properties to engage with local governments and \nother organizations and stakeholders to ensure the resilience of \nboth real estate holdings and the surrounding community. Real \nestate owners can\u2019t work in isolation in this area: engagement\u2014\nnot just with local organizations but also with insurers that have \nmore\texperience\tanalyzing\tclimate\trisks\u2014is\u00a0critical.\nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 2025116Harnessing New Opportunities for Canadian Real Estate \nCompanies\nAddressing climate change involves more than resilience and \nadaptation. Companies can consider a broad range of actions\u2014\nfrom introducing new climate-friendly products and services \n(such as solar panels and geothermal heating) to adopting \nnature-based solutions. These actions may involve costs, and \nmany interviewees expressed concern about their effect on \nfinancial\treturns.\tBut\tincreasing\tevidence\tshows\tthere\tdoesn\u2019t \t\nnecessarily have to be a negative tradeoff. In fact, advanced \nanalysis  of responses to PwC\u2019s latest CEO Survey  showed a \npositive link between actions related to climate change and \nsuperior\tfinancial\tperformance\treported\tby\tbusiness\texecutives.As real estate companies come under increasing pressure \nto change how they do business in response to climate \nchange, harnessing emerging opportunities will be key, as \nsome interviewees acknowledged in discussions this year. \n\u201cReinvention in the real estate sector will be driven by a shift \ntoward environmental sustainability,\u201d one interviewee said.\nOthers put it differently but nevertheless hinted at the urgency \nto continue the ESG and climate change journey. \u201cESG . . . is a \nbody of water,\u201d said one interviewee. \u201cEverybody needs to get \non a boat and cross the body of water. It doesn\u2019t matter who \ncrosses\tit\tfirst,\tbut\tyou\tcan\u2019t\tbe\tleft\tbehind.\u201d\nAnother important item on the sustainability agenda for \nCanadian real estate companies is the evolving landscape \naround ESG reporting requirements and regulations. After \nyears of uncertainty, there\u2019s now increasing alignment \nin\tCanada\taround\tthe\tsustainability-related\tfinancial \t\ninformation and climate-related disclosures outlined by the \nInternational Sustainability Standards Board. While these \ndisclosures will apply most directly to public real estate \ncompanies once the Canadian Securities Administrators \nadopts them, other industry players can expect them to \naffect their own stakeholders\u2019 expectations for the type of \nESG reporting they provide.\nFor now, pressure around environmental performance and \ndisclosure is most immediate for those looking to access \ninstitutional capital. Banks and large institutional investors, \nincluding pension funds, need to be able to quantify the \ngreenhouse gas emissions related to the capital they\u2019re \ndeploying. Many of these organizations have set ambitious \nnet-zero targets and are eager to fund companies\u2014often on \npreferential\tterms\tas\tpart\tof\tsustainable\tfinance\tactivities\u2014\nthat will help them achieve these goals.\nThe ongoing evolution of ESG-related laws and regulations \nalso puts a bigger focus on the quality of companies\u2019 \ndisclosures and the controls in place to ensure trusted reporting. The passing into law of Bill C-59, which \nintroduced changes to the Competition Act, in June \n2024 underscores the growing imperative around quality \nreporting and disclosures. Under the new law, any Canadian \norganization found to be misrepresenting environmental \nclaims\tto\tthe\tpublic\twill\tbe \tsusceptible\tto\tfines\tof\tup\tto\t3 \t\npercent of global revenues.\nESG performance a growing differentiator for offices\nWhile ESG issues are a growing focus across the real estate \nindustry,\tthey\tcan\tbe\teven\tmore\trelevant\tfor\toffices.\tOffice \t\ntenants\tare\tincreasingly\tasking\tdifficult\tquestions\tabout \t\nthe extent to which prospective lessors can help them with \ntheir own transitions and meet greenhouse gas emission \ndisclosure requirements and reduction targets.\nThe overall sense in the industry is that being able to \nprovide this information won\u2019t yet be enough to land an \noccupier, but it\u2019s becoming a prerequisite to be considered \nby marquis tenants. And as corporate commitments to \ndecarbonize rise, the demand for sustainable buildings is \nexpected to do the same, affecting leasing activities, rent \ngrowth, and vacancy rates. As one interviewee aptly put it, \nESG is becoming \u201cmore and more top of mind, almost to \nthe point where there\u2019s a minimum ESG standpoint.\u201dIn Focus: The Evolving ESG Landscape and the Implications  \nfor Canadian Real EstateEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 2025117\nChapter 4: Emerging Trends in Canadian Real Estateannounced $52.5 million in additional funding for the program, \nthrough which developers can receive up to $75 per square foot \nfor\toffice-to-residential\tconversion\tprojects.\t The\tcity\tnoted\tit \t\nhad\tapproved\t11\tconversions\tunder\tthe \tprogram,\twith\tthe \tfirst \t\ncompleted project opening in April 2024 with 112 rental units.\nThe industrial market is healthy but not as strong as last year. \nThe city had an industrial vacancy rate of 3.3 percent in the \nsecond quarter of 2024. At least one interviewee expects \nto see healthy demand as Calgary \u201cwill continue to be the \ndistribution hub for western Canada.\u201d\nMarkets to Watch\nCalgary\n\u201cCanada has discovered Western Canada, and international \nmarkets have discovered Western Canada,\u201d said one interviewee. \nIn addition to a diversifying economy supported by a growing \ntechnology sector, the city is seeing strong population growth \nas large numbers of people move to Calgary from across \nthe country and around the world. In the year ending July 1, \n2023, almost 27,000 arrived from other provinces and more \nthan 60,000 people came to the city from abroad, according \nto Statistics Canada. On the economic front, the Conference \nBoard of Canada (CBoC) expects real gross domestic product \n(GDP) growth to rise to 2.5 percent in 2025 from 1.1 percent in \n2024. The city\u2019s strength is evident in this year\u2019s survey, in which \nCalgary ranked No. 1 for overall real estate prospects in 2025.\nWith\tthe\tinflux\tof\tpeople\tto\tCalgary,\tinterviewees\tbroadly \t\nagreed that the single-family and multifamily residential \nsegments present the most opportunity. Housing starts are \nexpected to reach a new high in 2024 and maintain this level \nin 2025, according to CMHC. Calgary had the fastest-growing \nresidential construction costs of major Canadian cities in the \nsecond quarter of 2024, according to Statistics Canada, but \nrising rents and sales prices have helped interviewees maintain \ntheir margins.\nHousing affordability has been a big draw for people from \nother parts of Canada; but as demand increases, some worry \nthis may change. Alberta doesn\u2019t have rent control, and rental \nvacancies are low. As a result, average rents are projected \nto rise by 9.7 percent in 2024 and by 3.4 percent in 2025, \naccording to CMHC. Still, the forecasted average rent of $1,859 \nin 2024 for a two-bedroom apartment remains below cities like \nVancouver ($2,380) and Toronto ($2,120).\nA large portion of workers in Calgary have returned to the \noffice\tbecause\tmany\temployers\tmandated\tthat\tthey\tdo\tso,\tand \t\ncommute times are less onerous than in other cities.

Amid elevated vacancy, \nthe municipal government has a program to support projects \nto\tconvert\toffice\tspace\tinto\tresidences,\thotels,\tand\tacademic \t\nspaces. In a news release in September 2024, the City of Calgary \nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 2025118Vancouver\nVancouver\u2019s real GDP is expected to grow by 1.0 percent in 2024 \nand 2.6 percent in 2025, according to CBoC forecasts.

While there have \nbeen some examples of distressed condo projects, many local \ndevelopers with a long history in the city are well-capitalized \nand can manage through the development slowdown.\nVancouver is expected to have an apartment vacancy rate \nof 0.8 percent in 2024 and 0.9 percent in 2025, according to \nCMHC, and the availability of affordable housing is a pressing \nissue. The average rent for a two-bedroom apartment is \nforecast to be $2,580 per month in 2025, the highest in \nCanada. CMHC expects housing starts to decline slightly \nin 2024 and then resume growth in 2025. British Columbia \nalso stands out for a number of policy changes aimed at \naddressing affordability, including setting minimum density \nrequirements near transit stations. While some interviewees \nquestioned the impact of many policy changes due to slow \nimplementation, they expressed warmer sentiment toward \nthe minimum density requirements, which are helping bolster \ndevelopment projects near transit.\nVancouver has many apartments built in the 1960s and 1970s, \nand developers are exploring options to replace them with \nhigher-density buildings. The Broadway plan, which came into \neffect in 2022, is a 30-year initiative approved by the City of \nVancouver to transform the neighbourhood along a key city thoroughfare. It allows for replacement of these older, often \nsmaller multifamily buildings with towers up to 40 storeys in \nsome locations. \nAs of the second quarter of 2024, Vancouver had the lowest \ndowntown\toffice\tvacancy\trate\tamong\tmajor\tCanadian\tcities \t\nat 10.8 percent, according to CBRE. While interviewees said \nthey\twere\thappy\twith\tthe\tperformance\tof\ttheir\toffice\tportfolios, \t\nthey expressed little interest in adding exposure or developing \nnew product. As with other markets, prospective tenants are \nseeking newer, higher-quality properties.\nThe Vancouver area industrial market is healthy, but growth \nis tapering off. Vacancy rates increased in the second quarter, \nand net rents were 5.2 percent lower on a year-over-year basis, \naccording to Colliers. Speculative building has slowed, but \nstrong interest in build-to-suit developments remains.\nThe retail segment is evolving toward smaller-footprint, \nexperience-centered stores with less inventory space. This \ntype of space is particularly popular with pure online retailers \nlooking to establish a physical presence.

The growth \nwill come from the multiunit residential segment. Single-family \nstarts aren\u2019t likely to increase due to existing unsold inventory \nand rising costs.\nThe industrial market remains strong and may continue to \nperform well as the city\u2019s economy is expected to see rising \ngrowth in the next few years. Saskatoon\u2019s real GDP is expected \nto grow by 2.2 percent in 2025, according to the CBoC. \nAccording to Colliers, the industrial vacancy rate was just 1.5 \npercent in the second quarter of 2024. About 300,000 square \nfeet of speculative inventory is scheduled to come on the \nmarket in 2024.\nOttawa\nOttawa\u2019s population is growing as a result of both international \nand intraprovincial migration. After weak real GDP growth in \n2024, the CBoC expects it to be steady at about 2.3 percent for \nthe next several years.\nThe growing population and healthy economy are pushing \nvacancy rates down and rents higher. Vacancies are \nexpected to be 2.5 percent in 2025, with rents predicted to \nrise 4.5 percent, according to CMHC. On the ownership side, \nhomebuyers are being forced to seek affordability at the city\u2019s \nouter edges and in neighbouring communities. \nMainly west of downtown, many multiunit residential \ndevelopments are underway, but interest rates will need to \ndecline further for new projects to be launched. Similarly, well-\nlocated, conservatively leveraged condo developments already \nunder construction are proceeding, but interest in launching \nnew projects is limited.\nOttawa is facing a growing need to reimagine its downtown.

However, the government did recently identify \na number of publicly owned buildings in the city that could be \ncandidates for conversion to housing. A developer has bought at \nleast one former government building and intends to tear it down \nand build multiunit residential housing on the land.\nIn the industrial segment, the city had a vacancy rate of 1.8 \npercent in the second quarter of 2024, according to Colliers. \nA couple of large-scale distribution centres were recently \ncompleted to take advantage of the location between major \nmarkets in Toronto and Montreal, but small-bay facilities are \nnow a key driver of industrial activity.\nHalifax\nHalifax has boomed over the past couple of years. While \neconomic conditions have moderated\u2014the CBoC expects \nreal GDP growth to reach 1.4 percent in 2024 and 2.0 percent \nin 2025\u2014pressure on housing from population growth has \nleft vacancy rates low and rents rising. Despite a temporary \n5.0 percent provincial cap on existing leases, average rents \nfor a two-bedroom apartment are expected to increase by \n9.0 percent in 2024 and 5.6 percent in 2025, driven by a \nvacancy rate forecast to remain close to 1.0 percent next year, \naccording to CMHC. As a result of this tight market, a record \nnumber of rental units are under construction, and housing \nstarts are expected to increase through 2026. \nAffordability is a key issue as rental growth is forecast to outpace \nhousehold incomes, according to the CBoC. As affordability \nchallenges rise, land scarcity and prices are pushing single-\nfamily development farther outside the city, particularly along the \nHalifax\u2013Truro\tcorridor.\tAt\tthe\tsame\ttime,\tthe\tpush\tto\tincrease \t\ndensity is gathering steam. The city has adopted a number of \nzoning changes, including allowing multiple units on a lot and \ntaller buildings along transit routes. The effort to increase density \ncomes as the city looks to mitigate affordability pressures and \naccelerate housing development. RBC\u2019s aggregate affordability \nmeasure\tfor\tHalifax\treached\t46.9\tpercent\tin\tthe \tfirst\tquarter\tof \t\n2024, up from 42.1 percent during the same period last year.\nThe\tvacancy\trate\tin\tthe\tHalifax\toffice\tmarket\twas\t13.6\tpercent \t\nin the second quarter of 2024, which is the lowest since the \nsame period in 2015, according to CBRE.

Recent industrial development has led to a land \nshortage in the most desirable locations, and while existing \nbuildings are performing well, few deals are in the pipeline for \nthose looking to enter this asset class.\nInterviewees are generally bullish on their retail investments. \nThey mentioned pursuing strategies to create further value and \noptimize their portfolios through, for example, the addition of \ngrocery stores to non-anchored properties or by incorporating \nresidential uses into assets with existing necessity-based \nretail\u00a0offerings.\nQuebec City\nAfter negative real GDP growth in 2023, Quebec City\u2019s \neconomy is expected to recover slightly in 2024 and grow \n1.9 percent in 2025. Despite soft economic growth, the CBoC \nforecasts that the unemployment rate will remain low at 3.2 \npercent in 2024 and 3.1 percent in 2025.\nHousing starts are expected to decline in 2024 and then \nrecover slightly in 2025, according to CMHC. Multifamily \nhousing is one of the strongest asset classes in Quebec City, \nand it\u2019s expected to remain so as the ongoing shortage of \nrental units fuels construction. The vacancy rate for two-\nbedroom apartments is expected to be 0.7 percent in 2024 and \n0.6 percent in 2025, according to CMHC.\nDemand for condos is low, as is interest in developing them. \nDevelopers are focusing on rental units, with some shaping \ntheir projects to be eligible for CMHC programs.

Both projects have faced \nuncertainty, and while they appear to be going ahead, real \nestate players are waiting to see what happens before moving \nforward with their own developments.Emerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 2025123\nChapter 4: Emerging Trends in Canadian Real EstateProperty Type Outlook\n \nIndustrial Property\nFor the past few years, the industrial market in Canada has \nbeen the jewel of the various real estate classes. Demand has \nbeen particularly strong for warehouse space and distribution \ncentres, which has led to very positive absorption levels, low \nvacancy rates, and bullish construction activity.\nAt present, the market isn\u2019t as strong as it has been in the past \nfew years. But it remains quite healthy as it continues to stabilize \nfollowing a very hot period of activity. According to a report by \nColliers, the national availability rate in the industrial market rose \nto 4.4 percent in the second quarter of 2024. As the vacancy \nrate in many large cities rises and rents soften or in some cases \ndecline, construction activity in the industrial market has slowed.\nBut while the froth is off from what some would describe as \nan overheated market in recent years and the appetite for big \nspace has fallen, some interviewees see opportunities for \ngrowth. The areas of interest include the strong prospects \nfor data centres, the continued appeal of self-storage units \nfor people living in smaller homes, and the rising demand for \ncold-storage food spaces to serve online grocery businesses. \nDemand\tfor\tsmall-bay\tindustrial\tspace\tis\talso\tsignificant.\nEven with the slowdown, the industrial segment remains \nattractive to some real estate players\u2014particularly those already \npresent in this asset class\u2014as Canada\u2019s growing population \nfuels demand. Interviewees said they\u2019re adapting to softening \nconditions by focusing more on build-to-suit developments than \nspeculative building. They\u2019re also building smaller developments \nwith multiple tenants to reduce the risk of relying on one large \ncompany that could leave and be hard to replace.\nRetail Property\nFor\tthose\twary\tof\tthe\tongoing\tchallenges\tin\tthe\toffice\tmarket \t\nor who may be more pessimistic about the future of a softening \nindustrial segment, the retail turnaround that continues to take \nshape\tpoints\tto\tthe\tbenefits\tof\tkeeping\tan\teye\ton\tthe\tlong\tterm. \t\n\u201cRetail has not succumbed to the Armageddon prognosis of the \nlast several years,\u201d said one interviewee. As another interviewee \nexplained, the lack of new retail development has led to an \nundersupply in this asset class.\nAt\tthe \tsame\ttime,\tfoot\ttraffic\thas\trecovered\tin\tmany\tareas\tof \t\nthe retail market. Predictions that consumers would continue \nto move away from shopping in physical environments \nhave turned out to be exaggerated: Online retail activity has stabilized, and more and more people are returning to physical \nstores. According to PwC\u2019s 2024 Voice of the Consumer \nSurvey , 48 percent of Canadian respondents said they had \nshopped in physical stores on at least a weekly basis in the \nprevious 12 months, up from 43 percent in 2023.\nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 2025124As\tCanadians\tgrapple \twith\tinflationary\tpressures,\tinterviewees \t\nnoted that consumer spending is tilting toward non-\ndiscretionary categories. For real estate players, the biggest \nappetite these days is for grocery-anchored neighbourhood \nshopping centres as well as properties incorporating tenants \nsuch as pharmacies, discount retailers, banks, and personal \nservices. Neighbourhood retail is one area of the market \nwhere interviewees said the shortage of available space is \nparticularly acute. One interviewee said that with little new \nsupply available, landlords will be able to ask key tenants like \ngrocery stores to pay higher rents to have locations built.\nOther areas of the retail real estate landscape, such as enclosed \nmalls, continue to transform. Property owners are adapting \nto a changing business landscape in which traditional anchor \nretailers downsize or, in some cases, close down. Some have been able to divide those big spaces to accommodate more \nthan\tone\ttenant.\tAnd\tas\tone\tinterviewee\tsaid,\t\u201cThe\tdefinition\tof \t\nan anchor tenant in retail has changed,\u201d as landlords incorporate \ndifferent types of retailers, such as specialty food stores, into \nspaces previously occupied by traditional anchor tenants. Overall, \nsome interviewees said the retail segment is evolving toward \nsmaller formats, in part due to the challenges landlords face \nwhen dealing with turnover by larger tenants.\nOffice\nThe hybrid working model has taken hold in Canada, with \nthe\tconsequent\timpacts\ton\toffice\tproperties.\tAccording\tto \t\nPwC\u2019s 2024 Hopes and Fears Survey , 53 percent of Canadian \nemployees said they were in hybrid working arrangements \nthis year. Another 30 percent said they were working remotely \non a full-time basis. Only 18 percent reported having a fully \nin-person work arrangement. This shift has contributed to \nan\televated\tbut\tlargely\tstabilizing\toffice\tvacancy\trate\tacross \t\nCanada in both downtown and suburban markets. As the \nmarket continues to evolve, interviewees said lenders are \ngenerally\thesitant\tabout\tfinancing\toffices.\nThe bifurcation trend is clearly deepening, with one interviewee \nsaying it\u2019s more pronounced than ever as newer class A space \nis in demand while many older buildings struggle. According to \nCBRE, the class A vacancy rate was 17.1 percent in the second \nquarter of 2024, which was down slightly from 17.3 percent \nduring the same period last year.

With the price low enough \nand a view toward the long term, some said they were eyeing \nor\thad\tpursued\tspecific\tbuying\topportunities\twith\tthe\tright \t\ncharacteristics to create value. Strategies include holding onto \nassets bought at low prices with existing tenants or potentially \nknocking down or repurposing buildings in the future for \nredevelopment to residential uses.\nProximity to transit has also become a key differentiator \nfor\toffices,\tparticularly\tin\t Toronto\twhere\ttraffic\tcongestion \t\nis a major source of friction for workers looking to avoid long driving commutes. Other differentiators include design \nfeatures that support enhanced workplace collaboration, \norganizational performance, and productivity as well as spaces \ntailored to different employee needs and tasks.\nWhile conversion of older buildings to housing is a topic of \ndiscussion, interviewees emphasized that project viability \nusually depends on government incentives, such as the one \noffered in Calgary. Interviewees suggested other cities looking \nto\treduce\toffice\tvacancy\tand\trevitalize\ttheir\tdowntowns\tshould \t\nconsider incentives similar to Calgary\u2019s.\nPurpose-built Rental Housing\nThis property type ranks as a best bet for investment in 2025 \nas the country grapples with a housing supply shortage \nin practically every community, from smaller towns to \nmajor\u00a0centres.\nOver the years, a combination of factors has led Canada to \nthis point in the housing cycle: Canada\u2019s population growth \nhas surged in recent years. Much of the rental housing \nstock in Canadian cities consists of older buildings. Housing \naffordability is driving more people to the rental market as \nhomeownership becomes less attainable for a growing \nnumber of Canadians. Demand for student housing has \nincreased. And a steadily growing elderly population is looking \nfor rental homes catering to seniors.\nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 2025126developers to proceed with condo developments. Developers \nare also facing challenges on the revenue side as investors, \nwho make up a large portion of new condo buyers in many \nmarkets, pull back. \nNot only do high interest rates and other factors mean \ninvestors are more likely to lose money on renting out new \nunits; but the wide gap in key markets like Toronto between \nresale and new condo prices is helping depress the presales \nactivity that developers depend on. As one interviewee \ndescribed, whereas developers used to be able to sell out in \neight months, they now need a presale period of up to two \nyears. Besides the buildup of unsold inventory as developers \ndeal with the large number of units already under development, \nthey\u2019re also facing challenges from committed buyers who are \nhaving trouble closing on their purchases of new condos.\nAll these factors together have brought the condo market \nto a grinding halt compared to what it was a few years ago. \nWhile the issues are most acute in Toronto and Vancouver, \ninterviewees expressed a broad sense that condo activity \nis\tseeing\ta\tsignificant\tslowdown\tacross\tthe\tcountry. \t\nDevelopers might proceed with projects that have already \nbegun construction, with those in locations with good transit \naccess more likely to continue. But many are holding back on \nlaunching new builds. One interviewee noted that even with \nthe current slowdown, opportunities may still be available in \nspecific\tsituations,\tsuch\tas\tconversions\tof\tretail\tproperties \t\nto\u00a0condos.\nFor now, the market is on pause, a situation expected to \ncontinue into 2025 as developers have already accounted for \nexpected interest rate reductions by the Bank of Canada. But \nthe slowdown may create a shortage in subsequent years as \ndevelopers face pent-up demand from buyers currently on \nthe\u00a0sidelines.\nSingle-family Housing\nThe biggest issue facing the single-family housing market \nin Canada today is affordability. RBC\u2019s recent housing \naffordability index report showed the depth of the challenge \nfor\tsingle-family\thomebuyers.\tIn\tthe \tfirst\tquarter\tof\t2024,\tthe \t\nshare of household income required to cover ownership costs \nin Canada was 67.2 percent for single-family homes. In the \nVancouver area, it was a whopping 137.8 percent, followed by \nToronto at 96.3 percent.In this environment, rents have skyrocketed in many parts \nof the country. Recently, though, the market has softened in \nsome\tcities.\t These\ttrends,\talong\twith\tCMHC\tfinancing\tand\tthe \t\nwaiver of the federal GST and sales taxes in some provinces, \nhave brightened the prospects for purpose-built rental housing \nin Canada.\nHowever, challenges remain. CMHC noted in its spring 2024 \nhousing market outlook report that higher interest rates have \nmade\tit\thard\tfor\tbuilders\tand\tdevelopers\tto\tget\tfinancing.\t\nInterviewees said that while policy changes like the GST and \nsales tax waivers have helped somewhat, they\u2019re not enough \nto make up for other challenges developers are facing in \nbuilding new rental homes. Some suggested that the current \nenvironment\u2014in which condo building activity is slowing \nmarkedly\u2014offers a moment-in-time opportunity to build rental \nhousing. But they emphasized this development will materialize \nonly if governments offer further relief from rising costs \nthrough\tmeasures\tsuch\tas\treducing\tdevelopment\u00a0charges.\nCMHC is anticipating an increase in purpose-built rental \ncompletions in the coming years due to the large number of \nstarts\tin\t2021\u20132023.\tBut\tit\texpects\trental\tmarkets\twill\tremain \t\ntight due to high demand. While this prediction bolsters the \noutlook for companies involved in rental housing, interviewees \nnoted they\u2019re being selective in pursuing opportunities, with \ndecisions based on factors such as location, the impacts of \nregulatory issues like rent control, and the degree of tenant \nturnover. In some cases, interviewees said they\u2019re looking to \nreplace existing buildings with newer, denser developments \nfeaturing smaller units.\nSome interviewees expect the biggest opportunities to \ncome from existing rental product, either from buildings they \nalready own or ones they buy to take advantage of rising \nrents. And while developing new product remains challenging, \ninterviewees said decisions on whether to move ahead with \ndevelopment will depend on time horizons. Companies with \na\tlonger-term\toutlook\twill\tfind\trental\thousing\tmore\tattractive \t\nthan those looking for a quicker payback, interviewees noted.\nCondominium\nThe new condo market in Canada is struggling. High interest \nrates and increasing costs to build a project are creating \nchallenging conditions for developers across the country. \nIn\tmarkets\tlike\t Toronto\tand\tVancouver,\ta\tsignificant\tmarket \t\nslowdown is underway as it becomes too costly for many Emerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 2025127\nChapter 4: Emerging Trends in Canadian Real Estateat increasing the province\u2019s housing supply. These include \nmeasures making it easier to increase density on single-family \nlots through laneway homes, garden suites, and basement \napartments. The interest in the single-family rental segment \nalso came through in our survey, in which respondents listed \nthis area as having strong investment prospects among \ncommercial and multifamily subsectors in 2025.\nBest Bets for 2025\n1. Purpose-built rental housing:  This segment of multifamily \nhousing has risen to the best bet for 2025, thanks to its solid \nfundamentals\tand\tlong-term\toutlook.\t The\tsector\tbenefits \t\nfrom strong population growth and the relative affordability of \nrenting versus buying a home, two key demand drivers helping \nkeep vacancy rates low in many cities. Interviewees see strong \nprospects in markets where rents have more room to grow.\nWhile the sector is experiencing many of the same cost \npressures\tas\tother\tresidential\tcategories,\tit\tbenefits\tfrom \t\npublic policies (such as the GST and provincial sales tax \nwaivers) as well as CMHC programs and other incentives \naimed at stimulating supply and supporting developments Even so, CMHC reported 10,284 single-detached housing starts \nin\tthe\tfirst\thalf\tof\t2024\tin\tCanada\u2019s\tsix\tlargest\tmetropolitan \t\nareas, an increase of 8.0 percent over the previous year.\nIn the meantime, the market is shifting in response to the \naffordability challenges. Some interviewees, for example, \nsaid they\u2019re seeing more interest in multigenerational homes. \nOthers noted they\u2019re building single-family homes with rental \noptions in mind. This concept can involve designing homes \nto accommodate rental suites, which makes them more \nappealing to investors or homeowners looking for extra \nincome to help cover homeownership costs. \nWhile the purpose-built rental segment is a key focus in the \nyear ahead, low-rise homes may also play a greater role in the \nrental\tmarket.\tA \treport\tby\tCushman\t&\tWakefield\tearlier\tthis \t\nyear noted that the shortage of rental units, caused in part by \nlong timelines to approve and bring new multifamily homes \nto market, is helping bolster the prospects for single-family \nalternatives in Ontario.\nOther key factors supporting the business case for single-\nfamily rental housing are regulatory changes in Ontario aimed \nEmerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 20251283. Niche assets:  The third best bet for 2025 is niche assets. \nThis category includes a variety of specialized property types \nthat\tcater\tto\tspecific\tmarket\tsegments\tor\tneeds\tand\tare\tless \t\ncorrelated to other real estate sectors. Some of the most notable \nniche assets that are seeing strong demand drivers and growth \nopportunities are data centres, student housing, cold storage, \nand select areas of senior housing. For example, data centres \nare\texpected\tto\tsee\tsignificant\tgrowth\tdue\tto\tthe\tincreasing \t\nreliance on digital technologies and cloud services and the rising \nadoption of generative AI, although they do face challenges such \nas power availability and cost. Student housing is a niche asset \nin a relatively fragmented market that offers good prospects for \nrevenue growth amid strong demand, limited supply, and high \ntenant turnover; but it also requires operational expertise, which \nmay turn off some real estate market participants.\nNiche assets aren\u2019t for everyone as they often involve higher \nrisks, regulatory requirements, and operational costs than \nconventional property types. These downsides are particularly \ntrue for assets like senior housing, which is leading some \ninterviewees to focus more on narrower segments\u2014like \nmultigenerational housing and smaller units catering to \nthose who are downsizing\u2014rather than traditional health-\ncare facilities. Despite the challenges, for those willing to \nexplore these segments, niche assets can offer higher returns, \ndiversification,\tand\topportunities\tto\tcreate\tvalue.with affordability components. Although some interviewees \nare focusing on investing in existing supply, others see \nopportunities to develop new units. The latter group includes \ndevelopers with condo projects that are no longer viable but \nmay be candidates for conversion to rental housing depending \non whether construction has started and the time horizon of \nthe companies involved.\n2. Industrial real estate: Another best bet for 2025 is industrial \nreal estate, which has seen strong growth in recent years due \nto the rise of e-commerce, logistics, and efforts to stimulate \nmanufacturing activities in Canada. Even so, vacancy and rental \nrates have softened, signaling a mixed outlook for the year \nahead: Some markets are expected to see more development \nand absorption, while others may experience a slowdown in \ntenant demand and rent growth.\nOverall, some interviewees said industrial real estate still offers \nstability and the ability to earn good risk-adjusted returns; others \nnoted companies will need to be even more discerning when \nlooking for the right opportunities and locations for investment \nand development. Some also suggested that the slowdown in \nconstruction could lead to a shortage of industrial property in the \ncoming years that will bolster the sector once again.Emerging Trends in Real Estate\u00ae 2025129\nIntervieweesAdi Development Group Inc.\nTariq Adi\nAEW Capital Management\nMike Acton\nMichael Byrne\nJoshua Heller\nLauren O\u2019Neil\nAffinius Capital\nWill McIntosh\nAGF Investments Inc.\nAsh Lawrence\nAlate Partners Inc.\nCourtney Cooper\nAlignvest Management \nCorporation\nSanjil Shah\nAllard Developments Inc.\nMike Martin\nAlliance Pr\u00e9vel Inc.\nLaurence Vincent\nAllied Properties Real Estate \nInvestment Trust\nMichael Emory\nCecilia Williams\nAmerican Realty Advisors\nStanley Iezman\nArlington Properties\nWilliam Morris Jr.\nArnon Development \nCorporation Limited\nGillie Vered\nAsana Partners\nStefan Neudorff\nBrian Purcell\nAscendant Capital Partners\nRussell Gimmelstob\nAspen Properties Ltd.\nGreg Guatto\nScott Hutcheson\nAtlantic Pacific\nBrett Duke\nAvenue Living \nMax Graham\nBain Capital Real Estate\nRyan Cotton\nJoe Marconi\nBen Brady\nBarclays Capital\nP .

In PwC\u2019s June 2024 Pulse Survey , 51% of executive respondents reported that they are \nprioritizing investment  in new technologies, primarily generative AI, over cost cutting. Additionally, 73% of respondents \nreported that they will use generative AI to make changes to their c ompany\u2019s business model. When it comes to \nimplementing AI, the top performers are organizations that  collaborate across the C -suite to make technology choices that \nlay the foundation for AI -centric transformation and new business models. These transformations will likely usher in the \nrise of more Chief AI Officers (CAIOs) . \nAn integral part of an AI -centric transformation is going  all in on cloud adoption  so data can be modernized to make it \neasier for AI to ingest. Data modernization makes data monetization easier \u2013\u2013  and that\u2019s helping the sector lead the pack \non business model reinvention.  \nEmbracing business model reinvention  \n \nSustaining high growth levels has become increasingly \ndifficult due to a combination of rising capital costs, \nintensifying competition and shifting consumer expectations. In PwC's June 2024 Pulse Survey\n, 76% of \nexecutives across all sectors said companies should overhaul their business models or risk failure within a decade. Quick adaptation amid disruption is crucial for survival.  \nIn response to these challenges , we\u2019re seeing companies \nin the sector embrace business model reinvention by collaborating with other organizations to collectively create and share value by engaging within business ecosystems\n. \nNot only are these  companies embracing business model reinvention, they\u2019re \nachieving significantly better margins  by engaging in these \nbusiness ecosystems. TMT companies  that act as  \necosystem drivers enjoy margins of 50% to 60%, \ncompared to the 30% to 35%  mar gins seen in traditional \nproduct -led firms. Ecosystems are offering access to new \nmarket segments, foster consumer loyalty, and drive innovation by enabling deeper collaboration among \nparticipants.\n \n  \n \n   \n \n What\u2019s top of mind for TMT business leaders as we head into the fourth quarter of 2024? They\u2019re looking to \nunlock the full potential of AI -driven transformation by modernizing their data strategy and embracing \nbusiness ecosystems. TMT companies are reinventing their business models and using data to fuel growth, \ndespite rising challenges and evolving regulations.  \n Business  update   \nPwC  | TMT insights : Financial reporting and accounting quarterly \u2014 Q3 2024 3 Fueling  growth through data strategies  \n  \nData collaboration is helping create new value streams, especially for media and telecom \ncompanies. For media companies this is largely happening in the advertising space, such as \nallowing for more personalized, relevant ads that boost revenue without comp romising \nviewer privacy. For telecoms sitting on mountains of customer data, using technology like \ndata clean rooms to share data without violating privacy rules is allowing them to package \ndata insights as services and solutions \u2013\u2013 think market research and personalization \u2013\u2013 \nwithin their business ecosystem.  \nTMT companies are increasingly leveraging data strategies to drive growth and maintain competitiveness. \nUtilizing customer data, such as viewing habits and online behaviors, can help personalize user \nexperiences, enhance content offerings and explore new monetization opportunities. Mergers and \nacquisitions (M&A) are playing a crucial role in expanding data capabilities, allowing companies to access \nvaluable first -party data and integrate advanced technologies.  \nData -driven approaches present challenges, particularly in privacy and compliance. With \ngrowing global regulations and recent court rulings, TMT companies face the complex task of \nbalancing data utilization with adherence to privacy laws, which could affec t their data -driven \ngrowth initiatives. The Supreme Court\u2019s Chevron decision diminishes the interpretive power \nof agencies like the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Federal Trade \nCommission (FTC), leading to a more unpredictable regulatory envir onment. With increased \npotential for court challenges to agency interpretations, TMT companies could face \nheightened complexity and uncertainty in complying with evolving data privacy regulations \nthat could affect how TMT uses customer data in its deployme nt of automation and Artificial \nIntelligence (AI).   \nPwC  | TMT insights: Financial reporting and accounting quarterly \u2014 Q3 2024 4  \n    \nGetting ready for the new segment reporting requirements  \nPublic companies are required to apply the new segment reporting requirements in Accounting Standards Update ( ASU) \n2023- 07 for the first time for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. That means calendar year -end companies \nshould be planning now for the new disclosures that will be required in their 2024 Form 10- Ks. The new guidance requires \nincremental disclosures about reportable segments but does not change the definition of a segment, the method for \ndetermining segments or the criteria for aggregating operating segments into reportable segments. The most significant \nchange is the requirement to disclose significant segment expenses. Other requirements include disclosing the title and position of the individual or the name of the group identified as the chief operating decision maker (CODM) and how the CODM uses each reported measure of segment profit or loss to assess performance and allocate resources to the segment. All requirements also apply to public companies with one reportable segment and will be required in interim periods for years beginning after December 15, 2024.  \nAs companies evaluate the new requirements, here are some helpful reminders:  \nWhat is a \u201csignificant segment expense\u201d?  \nA significant segment expense is an expense that is: (1) regularly provided to or easily computed from information regularly provided to the CODM, (2) included in the reported measure of segment profit or loss, and (3) significant to the segment. Any expense incurred by the segment, including direct expenses, shared expenses, allocated corporate overhead, or interest expense, would represent a significant segment expense if it meets these criteria. The guidance requires significance to be assessed using both quantitative and qualitative factors. An expense category may be \nconsidered significant if its omission would change an investor\u2019s understanding of the segment results to a degree that it \nwould cause the investor to change its investment decisions. It \u2019s important to note that what a company identifies as \nsignificant expenses does not have to be the same across its reported segments.  \nDetermining if information is \u201cregularly provided\u201d \nWhile the prior segment guidance focused on information \"regularly reviewed\u201d by the CODM, the new guidance refers to significant segment expenses \u201cregularly provided\u201d to the CODM. The CODM could receive segment information in various ways, including hardcopy, electronically, or presented in a recurring meeting. Public companies should evaluate the segment information regularly provided to the CODM, taking into account advances in management information systems that make detailed information more readily available to the CODM, which may trigger additional segment disclosures.  \nMultiple measures of segment profit or loss  \nPreviously, public companies were permitted to disclose only one measure of segment profitability. The new guidance allows public companies to disclose multiple measures of segment profitability if the CODM uses multiple measures to assess segment performance and allocate resources. Companies will have to disclose the measure of segment profit or loss the CODM uses that is most consistent with the amounts included in their consolidated financial statements.  \nSince additional measures of segment profitability are voluntary, and the ASU does not address how such amounts \nshould be calculated (i.e., they are based on how management reviews segment performance), the U.S. Securities and \nExchange Commission ( SEC) staff has expressed a view in several public forums that any additional measures of \nsegment profitability included in the segment footnote that are not consistent with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP) would be considered non- GAAP financial meas ures. Although the SEC staff has indicated that it will \nnot object to the inclusion of additional measures of segment profitability, public companies will need to comply with the SEC\u2019s rules and interpretations for disclosures of non- GAAP measures, which include reconciliation requirements and \nprovisions that such measures not be misleading. Refer to our publication, \nSEC provides greater clarity on new segments \nguidance , f or additional information.  In this  issue, we highlight key reminders when adopting new segment reporting guidance, \nconsiderations when assessing goodwill for impairment and standard setting proposals expected to be \nreleased before the year\u2019s close.  Accounting update   \nPwC  | TMT insights: Financial reporting and accounting quarterly \u2014 Q3 2024 5 For more information \nTo learn more, read our publication, FASB updates segments guidance,  and chapter 25 of our Financial statement \npresentation guide . \nChecking in on annual goodwill impairment assessments  \nCompanies may perform their annual goodwill impairment assessment at any time during the year, as long as it \u2019s \nconsistently performed at the same time each year (although different reporting units may be tested at different dates). \nMany companies elect to perform the annual assessment in the months leading up to their fiscal year end, often choosing a date that aligns with the company\u2019s budgeting process.  \nThe guidance permits companies to first evaluate qualitative factors to determine if it \u2019s more likely than not that the fair \nvalue of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount (the \u201cstep 0\u201d test). If it is, a quantitative assessment is needed to \nidentify and measure any impairment loss. Otherwise, no further impairment testing is necessary. Conversely, companies \ncan proceed directly to a quantitative assessment. Companies can choose to perform the qualitative assessment on all, some, or none of its reporting units.  \nCurrent economic conditions and changes in the company\u2019s business can affect  how companies choose to perform the \nimpairment test. The following outlines some common situations and their potential impact.  \nScenario  Potential impact  \nRecently recorded \ngoodwill impairment charge  If a company recently recorded a goodwill impairment, there is likely minimal or no \u201ccushion\u201d \nbetween the fair value and carrying amount of the reporting unit. As such, if there are additional negative indicators, a quantitative impairment test is most likely warranted. It \u2019s not \nuncommon for companies to continue to record goodwill impairments in successive reporting \nperiods if negative trends continue.  \nLack of cushion in the \nmost recent quantitative impairment test   A qualitative assessment may not be effective or efficient if the amount of cushion between \nthe fair value and carrying amount of the reporting unit in the most recent quantitative assessment was not significant. A lack of cushion would cause the reporting  unit to be highly \nsensitive to adverse changes in economic factors.  \nSignificant amount of \ntime elapsed or changes \nin economic conditions \nsince the last quantitative impairment test Companies may elect to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test for a reporting unit \nif a significant amount of time has elapsed since the last quantitative test as a means of \nrefreshing its understanding of the extent of the cushion between fair value and carrying \namount. Companies should also consider if there have been negative economic indicators (either from a macroeconomic perspective or specifically related to the company\u2019s operations) that would render the most recent quantitative assessment less relevant, regardless of the \namount of time that has elapsed.  \nDecrease in a public \ncompany\u2019s market capitalization  A decrease in market capitalization may be an indication of market participant perception of \nthe value of the company\u2019s businesses and the risk associated with future projections, particularly if market capitalization is below book value. Even when total market capitalization exceeds book value, sustained decreases in the company\u2019s stock price could be an indication of a decrease in fair value of one or more reporting units. This negative economic factor can be an indicator that a qualitative assessment is not the most appropriate approach to evaluate \nimpairment.  \nRecent acquisitions  Recently acquired  reporting units are typically included in the annual impairment assessment \nas delaying inclusion until the next fiscal year would result in more than 12 months between assessments, which is prohibited. An alternative is to use a different date for the impairment assessment of a recent acquisition within 12 months of the acquisition's close.  For recent \nacquisitions, however, the company would have recently determined the fair value of the acquired entity, which could, in conjunction with the other considerations above, impact the \ndecision to perform a qualitative versus quantitative impairment test.  \n  \n  \nPwC  | TMT insights: Financial reporting and accounting quarterly \u2014 Q3 2024 6 For more information \nTo learn more, read chapter 9 of our Business combinations and noncontrolling interests guide . \nAICPA proposes updates to its \u201ccheap stock\u201d guide \nIn June, the Financial Reporting Executive Committee of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ( AICPA) \nreleased for public comment  a working draft of two updated chapters  from the AICPA  Valuation of Privately -Held \nCompany Equity Securities Issued as Compensation  Guide (the Guide), which is sometimes referred to as the \u201ccheap \nstock guide.\u201d The Guide provides non- authoritative interpretive guidance and illustrations related to the accounting for, \nvaluation of, and disclosures related to privately -held company equity  securities issued as compensation. There has been \nsignificant growth in the breadth and volume of secondary market transactions (i.e., third parties buying and selling \ncommon stock of the company directly from each other) since the prior update of the Gu ide in 2013. The AICPA working \ndraft addresses the evolution of these transactions and their impact on privately -held company stock valuations and \naccounting.  \nComments on the draft chapters were due September 20, and we expect the chapters to be finalized in 2025. The Guide interprets existing authoritative literature,  and the updates will not have a definitive effective date. We believe, therefore, \nthat even before they are finalized, affected companies should consider the guidance in the draft chapters when \nperforming any future valuations or accounting for secondary market transactions.  \nRead our publication, AICPA releases draft chapters of updated \"cheap stock\" guide\n, to learn more.   \nStandard setting proposals expected before year end   \nSince June, t he Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB) has released two proposals and is targeting the issuance \nof six additional  proposals before the end of 2024, making significant progress on their current technical agenda. Take \nadvantage of  the opportunity to weigh in on these  proposed amendments and participate in this important step in the \nFASB\u2019s due process.  \nProposed amendments to derivatives and revenue scoping  \nOn July  23, the FASB  proposed  new accounting guidance that would create an exception for certain contracts from being \naccounted for as derivatives and clarify the accounting for share- based payments received from customers in revenue \narrangements. Feedback on the proposal is due by October 21. For a summary of the proposal, read our publication, \nFASB proposes amendments on derivatives and revenue scoping . \nProposed amendments to derivatives and revenue scoping  \nOn September 25, the FASB proposed new accounting guidance that would provide targeted updates designed to better \nportray the economic results of an entity\u2019s risk management activities in its financial statements. Feedback on the proposal is due by November 25. \nPwC  | TMT insights: Financial reporting and accounting quarterly \u2014 Q3 2024 7 Additional proposals expected before the end of 2024  \n \nFASB project  Summary  \nSoftware costs  Targeted improvements to the guidance on internal -use software development costs  \nEnvironmental credit \nprograms  Accounting and disclosure for participants in compliance and voluntary programs that \nresult in the creation of environmental credits  \nGovernment grants  Accounting by business entities for cash or tangible nonmonetary grants received from \na government entity  \nInterim reporting  General principle for interim reporting and compilation of existing interim disclosure \nrequirements  \nDetermining the acquirer in \nthe acquisition of a variable \ninterest entity  Clarification that the existing factors in business combinations guidance should be \napplied to determine the accounting acquirer  \nShare -based consideration \nto a customer  Clarification of the definition of a \u201cperformance condition\u201d for share -based payments to a \ncustomer  \nFor the latest project updates and expected timing, refer to the FASB\u2019s current projects  page.  \n \n     \nDevelopments in sustainability reporting \nWe are pleased to announce the release of the next install ment  of content in our inaugural global Sustainability \nreporting  guide . This guide details the requirements under the primary sustainability reporting frameworks with \nextraterritorial provisions. We provide our insights and perspectives, interpretive and application guidance, and illustrativ e \nexamples related to the:   \n\u2022 European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) adopted by the European Commission for purposes of \ncompliance with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)  \n\u2022 IFRS\u00ae Sustainability Disclosure Standards issued by the International Sustainability Standards Board  \n\u2022 Climate disclosure rules issued by the SEC  \nThe guide details the foundational and general disclosure requirements under each framework, with helpful analysis about  \ninteroperability. We also provide separate chapters dedicated to the materiality assessment and greenhouse gas \nemissions reporting.   \nMore chapters will be issued this year addressing environmental, social, and governance topics and jurisdictional sustainability reporting regimes, as well as additional content related to the application of the EU Taxonomy Regulation.On the regulatory front, we provide updates on sustainability reporting across multiple frameworks and SEC \nguidance on cybersecurity incident reporting.  \n Regulatory update   \nPwC  | TMT insights: Financial reporting and accounting quarterly \u2014 Q3 2024 8 California climate disclosure amendments  \nIn August, the California State Legislature approved a bill that would amend two of California\u2019s climate disclosure laws. \nThe proposed amendments will become law unless vetoed by Governor Newsom before September 30. The California State Legislature adjourned on August 31 for the 2024 session, which means that no further amendments can be proposed this year.  \nThe proposed amendments are largely administrative in nature, although one amendment may make the required reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions easier for subsidiaries with parents that report GHG emissions. Further, although the governor of California had proposed a two- year extension of the timing for certain disclosures, no extension \nof the implementation dates was included in the final amendments.  \nProposed amendments in another bill would have affected the scope and timing of the law requiring disclosure of \ninformation about certain emissions claims and the sale and use of carbon offsets (California AB 1305). The legislature did not hold a final vote on the bill , and, as a result, no changes were approved.  \nFor more on what is included in these amendments, see our publication, \nCalifornia advances amendments to \nsustainability reporting laws . For more information on the California laws, see our publication, California's not waiting for \nthe SEC's climate disclosure rules . \nCorporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)  \nIn July, the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group ( EFRAG ) released a new compilation of explanations  based on \nquestions submitted to the ESRS Q&A Platform addressing questions submitted through July 2024. In August, the European Commission issued \nFAQs  on the interpretation of certain provisions in CSRD and ESRS.  \nBoth documents are intended to facilitate the implementation of the ESRS and do not introduce new guidance. Although non-authoritative, these resources may be helpful to preparers in interpreting the CSRD and ESRS requirements.  \nAs discussed in prior editions, EU Member States were to complete the transposition of the CSRD into local law by early July 2024. Many have yet to complete the transposition process. Until their process is complete, we expect that EU Member States will abide by the CSRD as published by the European Union.  \nFor more information  \nTo learn more about the fundamentals of the sustainability accounting and reporting landscape, register for our upcoming webcast, Sustainability reporting 101 \u2013 Back to basics\n, on October 22.  \nSEC staff provides guidance on cybersecurity incident reporting \nBeginning in December 2023, most registrants were required to report material cybersecurity incidents on new Item 1.05 of Form 8- K within four business days after the registrant determines that the incident is material. In the past quarter, the \nSEC staff h as continued to release statements and interpretative guidance clarifying certain aspects of this requirement:  \n\u2022 SEC Division of Corporation Finance Director Erik Gerding issued a statement  reminding registrants that nothing in the \nnew rules prohibits a registrant from providing information to other parties about material  cyber  incidents beyond what \nis disclosed in Item 1.05 of Form 8- K. Registrants should, however, consider the requirements  of Regulation FD in \nconnection with any such disclosures to private parties.   \n\u2022 The SEC staff issued five new compliance and disclosure interpretations  related to evaluating the materiality and Form \n8-K reporting requirements of ransomware- related  cybersecurity incidents.   \nFor more information, read our publications,  SEC adopts  cybersecurity disclosure rules , and Making materiality judgments \nin cybersecurity incident reporting .  \n9 \n  \n \n \n  \n \n Our TMT practice is dedicated to helping business leaders in the technology, media and \ntelecommunications industries manage their complex businesses while delivering sustained outcomes. \nIn doing so, we offer a range of capabilities, including risk, transformation, cloud and digital, deals, \nsustainability , cybersecurity and privacy, governance/boards, tax services and much more.
